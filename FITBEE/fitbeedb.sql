(2, 'How to Build an Exercise Plan', 'uploads/exc and fitness1.jpg', 'Exercise and Fitness', '2021-06-01 09:08:30', '<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">What type of exercise should you do?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no single type of exercise that can take care of all your needs. In fact, to get the most benefits from your routine, you want a mix of activities during the course of a week. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s like a diet consisting only of fruit&mdash;healthful as far as it goes, but lacking a lot of the nutrients you&rsquo;ll find in other foods, such as fish, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Developing a balanced exercise plan</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does a balanced exercise plan consist of? The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services urge all adults to include the following types of exercise in their weekly routines:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week (for example, 30 minutes on each of five days)<br />\r\n	or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity (or an equivalent mix of the two).</li>\r\n	<li>two or more strength training sessions per week, with at least 48 hours in between to allow muscles<br />\r\n	to recover.</li>\r\n	<li>balance exercises for older adults at risk for falls.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If this all sounds overwhelming, remember that workouts can be broken up into smaller segments. For example, three 10-minute walks can get you to your daily goal of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each workout should also include a simple warm-up at the beginning and a cool-down at the end. The warm-up should consist of gentle exercise, such as marching in place, to loosen up your muscles and get more oxygen-rich blood flowing to them. To cool down, slow your activity and the intensity for five to 10 minutes, then finish off with stretches to help prevent stiffness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read on to learn more about each component of a balanced exercise program in greater depth and suggest a mix of activities and exercises to get you going.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">Aerobic exercise (cardio)</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Often called cardio or endurance activities, aerobic activities are great for burning calories and paring down unwanted fat. They consist of activities that make the heart and lungs work harder:<br />\r\nthink of walking, biking, running, and swimming, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aerobic exercise temporarily boosts your heart rate and breathing, allowing more oxygen to reach your muscles and tuning up cardiovascular endurance. These are the activities that are associated with lower risk for many diseases and longer life span.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How much should you do?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend accumulating a weekly total of at least two- and-a-half hours of moderate aerobic activity, or one hour and 15 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity. (Note: If you prefer a mix, 10 minutes of vigorous activity equals roughly 20 minutes of moderate activity.) Raising your weekly goal to five hours of moderate activity, or two-and-a-half hours of vigorous activity, nets additional health benefits, especially weight loss. Each session should last at least 10 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Get started</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Walking is usually safe for people of any age or level of fitness and can easily be adjusted to a comfortable speed. It doesn&rsquo;t jar joints or raise your heart rate to dangerous levels. For a greater challenge, you can add time, distance, or hills to improve endurance or use resistance bands to tone while you walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow these tips to get the best workout from your walks:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find a safe place to walk.</strong>&nbsp;Quiet streets with side- walks, park trails, athletic tracks at local schools, or shopping malls are often good choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buy a good pair of shoes.</strong>&nbsp;Look for supportive but flexible soles that cushion your feet. Comfort is the key when buying shoes for walking. Shop at the end of the day when your feet are at their largest size. Choose shoes with &ldquo;breathable&rdquo; uppers, such as nylon mesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dress for comfort and safety.</strong>&nbsp;Wear lighter clothes than you&rsquo;d need if standing still. Dress in layers so you can peel off garments if you get hot. Light-colored clothes and a reflective vest help drivers notice you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do a five-minute warm-up and cool-down.</strong>&nbsp;Start off at a slower pace for your warm-up. At the end of your walk, slow down to cool down (even if you&rsquo;re not sweaty).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">Strength training</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength or resistance training, which typically employs equipment such as weight machines, free weights, or resistance bands or tubing, protects against bone loss and builds muscle. It also improves your body&rsquo;s ratio of lean muscle mass to fat. It, too, deserves an important place in your exercise routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically, strength or resistance training takes place any time your muscles face a stronger-than-usual counterforce, such as pushing against a wall or lifting a dumbbell. Using progressively heavier weights or increasing resistance makes muscles stronger. Aside from toning you, strength training provides the functional strength you need to do everyday activities&mdash; lifting groceries, climbing stairs, rising from a chair, rushing for the bus&mdash;with ease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How much should you do?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend strengthening exercises for all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms) two or more times a week, with at least 48 hours between sessions. One set per session is effective, though two or three sets may be better, according to some research. Repeat each exercise eight to 12 times (reps). Your body needs at least 48 hours for recovery and repair between strength training sessions in order to build more muscle and get stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Get started</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These tips for safe strength training will help you get the most from your workouts:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Focus on form, not weight.</strong>&nbsp;Align your body correctly and move smoothly through each exercise. Poor form can prompt injuries. Many experts suggest starting with no weight, or very light weight, when learning a strength training routine. Concentrate on slow, smooth lifts and equally controlled descents while isolating a muscle group. You isolate muscles by holding your body in a specific position while consciously contracting and releasing the targeted muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tempo, tempo.</strong>&nbsp;Tempo helps you stay in control rather than undercut strength gains through momentum. For example, count to four while lifting a dumbbell, hold for two, then count to four while lowering it to the starting position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Breathe.</strong>&nbsp;Blood pressure increases during a workout, but it rises even more if you hold your breath while performing strength exercises. To avoid steep increases, exhale as you lift, push, or pull; inhale as you release. To make sure that you&rsquo;re not holding your breath, count your tempo aloud. You can&rsquo;t hold your breath when you&rsquo;re talking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keep challenging muscles.</strong>&nbsp;The right weight differs depending on the exercise. Choose a weight that tires the targeted muscle or muscles by the last two repetitions (reps) while still allowing you to maintain good form. If you can&rsquo;t do the minimum number of reps, choose a lighter weight. When it feels too easy, as if you could continue doing reps, challenge your muscles again by adding weight (roughly 1 to 2 pounds for arms, 2 to 5 pounds for legs) or using a stronger resistance band. Alternately, you can add another set of reps to your workout (up to three sets), or work out additional days per week. If you add weight, remember that you should be able to do the minimum number of reps with good form, and the targeted muscles should feel tired by the last two reps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">Balance exercises</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our sense of balance typically worsens as we age. It can be further compromised by medical conditions like neuropathy (a complication of diabetes or certain chemotherapy drugs) that can cause tingling, pain, and numbness in the feet; side effects from other medications; uncorrected vision problems; or a lack of flexibility. Poor balance often leads to falls, which can cause head injuries and temporarily or permanently disabling injuries to the bones and nervous system. Hip fractures, particularly, can lead to serious health complications and can impair independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Older adults at risk for falls can benefit from a combination of walking, strength training, and balance exercises. Balance-enhancing activities include tai chi, yoga, and Pilates. Strength training exercises that work core muscles in your abdomen and back also help with balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How much should you do?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For older adults at risk for falls, the guidelines recommend 30 minutes of balance training and muscle strengthening exercises three times a week, plus at least 30 minutes of walking activities twice or more weekly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">Flexibility exercises</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Flexibility exercises like stretching and yoga gently reverse the shortening and tightening of muscles that typically occur with disuse and age. Shorter, stiffer muscle fibers may make you vulnerable to injuries and contribute to back pain and balance problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frequently performing exercises that isolate and stretch elastic fibers surrounding muscles and tendons helps counteract this. A well-stretched muscle more easily achieves its full range of motion. This improves athletic performance&mdash;imagine an easier, less restricted golf swing or tennis serve&mdash;and functional abilities, such as reaching, bending, or stooping during daily tasks. Stretching can also be a great way to get you moving in the morning or a way to relax after a long day. Activities such as yoga combine stretching and relaxation and also improve balance, a wonderful combination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, note that experts no longer recommend stretching before exercise. Prolonged stretching impedes the maximum contractile force of muscles. For example, stretching prior to jumping decreases jump height. Instead, experts now recommend starting off your exercise with a warm-up, such as an easy walk or a sport-specific routine such as serving some tennis balls and practicing ground strokes before a match. This increases the movement of blood and oxygen to the muscles. Then, when muscles are warm and pliable&mdash;for example, after five to 10 minutes of exercise&mdash;you can stretch. Or, even better, do your flexibility exercises as your post-workout cool-down.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How much should you do?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans present no specific recommendations for making flexibility exercises part of your routine. However, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends that older adults do flexibility exercises on the same days as aerobic or strength activities, or at least twice a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Get started</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>When starting a stretching routine, follow these tips for safety:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Check with your doctor. If you have joint disease or arthritis, or if you&rsquo;ve had a joint replacement, check with your doctor before starting stretching exercises.</li>\r\n	<li>Warm up first. Warm muscles are more flexible. Warm up for five to 10 minutes first, or save stretching for your cool-down routine after exercising.</li>\r\n	<li>Stretch all muscle groups. Just as with strength training, stretching should include all muscle groups.</li>\r\n	<li>No bouncing. Never bounce as you stretch. This triggers a contracting reflex that actually tightens the muscle you&rsquo;re trying to loosen.</li>\r\n	<li>Feel mild tension only. Extend your muscle to the point where you feel mild tension and hold that position. You should never feel pain.</li>\r\n	<li>Breathe. Breathe easily through your nose while stretching.</li>\r\n	<li>Hold and repeat. The best results come from holding a stretch for 10 to 30 seconds and repeating each stretch two to six times for a total of one minute.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n'),

It&rsquo;s much easier to get up and get moving every day when you actually experience the results you&rsquo;re looking for&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s trimming your waistline, improving your sleep, mood, and energy, or easing symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Whatever benefits you&rsquo;re looking for from a fitness plan&mdash;and whatever your current fitness level&mdash;the key is to mix different types of physical activity. The most effective exercise plans should include a mix of&nbsp;<strong>three elements</strong>: cardio (or aerobic) training, strength training, and flexibility and balance exercises. This will not only maximize the health benefits, it will also keep your workouts varied and interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Of course, you can always sign up for personal training sessions at a gym, find workout plans online, or download a fitness app, but developing the right exercise plan doesn&rsquo;t have to be that complicated or expensive. These simple guidelines can help you make the most of your time and reap all the health and weight loss rewards of regular exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How much exercise do I need?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The important thing to remember about exercise is that something is always better than nothing. By simply sitting less and moving more throughout your day, you can experience health benefits. For substantial health benefits, though, government guidelines in the U.S., UK, and other countries recommend that you aim for:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>At least</strong>&nbsp;<strong>150 minutes (2.5 hours)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of moderate-intensity</strong>&nbsp;<strong>activity per week</strong>. That&rsquo;s 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week, broken down into 10-minute bursts if that&rsquo;s easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>OR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>At least 75 minutes</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>&nbsp;<strong>vigorous-intensity</strong>&nbsp;<strong>exercise per week</strong>&nbsp;will deliver the same benefits, if your fitness level allows you to work out harder. That means running for 15 minutes, for example, instead of walking briskly for 30 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>OR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>You can combine both moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise</strong>, remembering the general rule of thumb that 2 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise is the equivalent of 1 minute of vigorous-intensity activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>AND DON&rsquo;T FORGET TO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Include muscle-strengthening activity at least twice a week</strong>&nbsp;as part of your weekly totals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Start slowly</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;ve never exercised before or have been sedentary for a long time, it&rsquo;s advisable (after consulting with your doctor) to start off slowly and gradually build up to these activity levels. Instead of 30 minutes of walking 5 days a week, for example, start with 5 or 10 minutes and build up from there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How many days a week should I work out?</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A recent study in the UK found that people who squeeze all their exercise into one or two sessions over the weekend experience&nbsp;<em>almost</em>&nbsp;as many health benefits as those who work out more often. However, spreading your exercise sessions across three or more days a week may help reduce your risk of injury and keep your energy levels up throughout the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Element 1: Cardio Exercise</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Cardiovascular or aerobic exercises are endurance activities that use your large muscle groups in rhythmic motion over a sustained period of time. Cardio workouts get your heart pumping and you&rsquo;ll breathe harder than normal and may even feel a little short of breath. Cardio activities include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Brisk walking</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Running</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Cycling</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Tennis</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Hiking</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Dancing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good for you:</strong>&nbsp;Whatever your age, cardio can help to increase your lung capacity, strengthen your heart and muscles, and improve your stamina and endurance. Cardio workouts can also:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Help control weight by burning calories and regulating appetite.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Lower blood pressure&nbsp;and control blood sugar.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Reduce the risk of falls in older adults.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Improve memory and thinking; even help prevent mental decline and&nbsp;manage symptoms of Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Reduce joint pain and stiffness.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Release tension, boost your mood, and help you to&nbsp;sleep better at night.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Walking: An easy introduction to cardio exercise</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Walking&nbsp;briskly for just 22 minutes a day will help you to reach your minimum weekly goal of 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise&mdash;and in the process, lower your risk of heart disease and obesity. Walking doesn&rsquo;t require any special skills or training. Aside from a comfortable pair of shoes, you don&rsquo;t need any specialized equipment, and it can be done almost anywhere. You just have to resolve to get up and go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Look for creative ways to fit a brisk walk into your daily schedule.</strong>&nbsp;Ditch the car and walk to the grocery store, for example, or take a walk during your lunch hour, or walk while you&rsquo;re talking on the phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Look for creative ways to fit a brisk walk into your daily schedule.</strong>&nbsp;Ditch the car and walk to the grocery store, for example, or take a walk during your lunch hour, or walk while you&rsquo;re talking on the phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Or make it a social event and walk with others</strong>. Invite friends, family members, or work colleagues to walk with you. Taking a walk can provide a great opportunity to catch up with an existing friend or strengthen the bond with a new one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Enjoy time in nature</strong>. Walking in parks, on beaches, or along hiking trails or riverbanks can add to the mood boost you experience from exercising. Spending time in nature can release endorphins, the brain&rsquo;s feel-good chemicals that improve mood and relieve stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Element 2: Strength Training</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">strength training, sometimes called resistance or power training, builds up muscles with repetitive motion using resistance from free weights, weight machines, elastic bands, or your own body weight. Power training is often strength training done at a faster speed to increase power and reaction times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Examples of strength and power training activities include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Push-ups and pull-ups using your own body weight as resistance.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Squats, curls, or shoulder presses using dumbbells, kettlebells, resistance bands or tubes, or even cans of food or other heavy household objects.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Exercising with weight machines in a gym or fitness center.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good for you:</strong>&nbsp;Strength training builds and tones muscle and increases lean muscle mass. Aside from improving how you look and feel, resistance and power training can also:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Help&nbsp;manage your weight&nbsp;by burning calories more efficiently and reducing body fat, especially around your middle.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Help you stay active and independent as you get older.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Improve your flexibility, balance, and mobility.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Prevent loss of bone mass.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>The do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of strength training</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You don&rsquo;t need to spend hours every day lifting weights to enjoy the benefits of strength training. Exercising the major muscle groups&mdash;legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms&mdash;in 20- to 30-minute sessions twice a week is enough to deliver results and help keep you toned and strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Always warm up before and cool down after strength training to reduce your risk of injury.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">If you&rsquo;re new to this type of exercise, it&rsquo;s important to learn the correct techniques to avoid injury. You can find free fitness classes at many community facilities. Apps and online video tutorials can also help, as can exercising in front of a mirror to ensure you&rsquo;re maintaining the right form as you work out.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">As you progress and get stronger, you can challenge your muscles again by adding weight or using a band with more resistance.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Always listen to your body and forget the old adage &ldquo;no pain, no gain.&rdquo; Strength training should never cause pain!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>The importance of core-strength exercises</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Many of us equate exercising our core with endless sit-ups and unobtainable images of washboard abs. But your core is much more than just your abdominal muscles. Your core stretches from below your breastbone down to your thighs and includes your back, sides, buttocks, and hips as well as your abdomen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A strong core can help you maintain good posture and carry out many different daily movements that involve twisting, bending, or rotating your body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Strengthening your core can also:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Prevent lower back pain.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Improve endurance.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Lower your risk of injury.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As well as abdominal crunches, activities that are particularly good at targeting your core include yoga, swimming, surfing&nbsp;, or performing perhaps the most popular core exercise, the plank.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Element 3: Flexibility and balance</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Flexibility challenges the ability of your body&rsquo;s joints to move freely through a full range of motion. Balance maintains stability, whether you&rsquo;re stationary or moving around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Good flexibility exercises include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Stationary stretches and stretches that involve movement.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Yoga.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;re already active, chances are you currently engage in exercises that improve balance, such as walking, hiking, cycling, or strength training.&nbsp;However, balance typically worsens as we age, so if you&rsquo;re an&nbsp;older adult&nbsp;looking to specifically improve your balance, you can do so by trying:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Yoga.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Exercises such as standing on one leg, walking backwards.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Strength training the muscles of your back, abdomen, and legs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Flexibility helps your body stay limber and increases your range of movement for sports as well as daily physical activities such as reaching, looking behind while driving, and bending to tie your shoes. Flexibility exercises that lengthen and stretch muscles also help to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Keep your muscles and less prone to injury.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Prevent back pain.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Prevent balance problems.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Increase circulation.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Relieve tension and stress.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n'),

Sure, exercise can improve your physical health and your physique, trim your waistline, improve your sex life, and even add years to your life. But that&rsquo;s not what motivates most people to stay active.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of well-being. They feel more energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, have sharper memories, and feel more relaxed and positive about themselves and their lives. And it&rsquo;s also a powerful medicine for many common mental health challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Regular exercise can have a profoundly positive impact on depression, anxiety, and ADHD. It also relieves stress, improves memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts your overall mood. And you don&rsquo;t have to be a fitness fanatic to reap the benefits. Research indicates that modest amounts of exercise can make a real difference. No matter your age or fitness level, you can learn to use exercise as a powerful tool to deal with mental health problems, improve your energy and outlook, and get more out of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Exercise and depression</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication&mdash;but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving&nbsp;depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Exercise and anxiety</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Exercise is a natural and effective&nbsp;anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins. Anything that gets you moving can help, but you&rsquo;ll get a bigger benefit if you pay attention instead of zoning out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Try to notice the sensation of your feet hitting the ground, for example, or the rhythm of your breathing, or the feeling of the wind on your skin. By adding this mindfulness element&mdash;really focusing on your body and how it feels as you exercise&mdash;you&rsquo;ll not only improve your physical condition faster, but you may also be able to interrupt the flow of constant worries running through your head.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Exercise and stress</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Ever noticed how your body feels when you&rsquo;re&nbsp;under stress? Your muscles may be tense, especially in your face, neck, and shoulders, leaving you with back or neck pain, or painful headaches. You may feel a tightness in your chest, a pounding pulse, or muscle cramps. You may also experience problems such as insomnia, heartburn, stomachache, diarrhea, or frequent urination. The worry and discomfort of all these physical symptoms can in turn lead to even more stress, creating a vicious cycle between your mind and body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Exercising is an effective way to break this cycle. As well as releasing endorphins in the brain, physical activity helps to relax the muscles and relieve tension in the body. Since the body and mind are so closely linked, when your body feels better so, too, will your mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Other mental health benefits of exercise</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Even if you&rsquo;re not suffering from a mental health problem, regular physical activity can still offer a welcome boost to your mood, outlook, and mental well-being. Exercise can help provide:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sharper memory and thinking.</strong>&nbsp;The same endorphins that make you feel better also help you concentrate and feel mentally sharp for tasks at hand. Exercise also stimulates the growth of new brain cells and helps prevent&nbsp;age-related decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Higher self-esteem.</strong>&nbsp;Regular activity is an investment in your mind, body, and soul. When it becomes habit, it can foster your sense of self-worth and make you feel strong and powerful. You&rsquo;ll feel better about your appearance and, by meeting even small exercise goals, you&rsquo;ll feel a sense of achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Better sleep.</strong>&nbsp;Even short bursts of exercise in the morning or afternoon can help&nbsp;regulate your sleep patterns. If you prefer to exercise at night, relaxing exercises such as yoga or gentle stretching can help promote sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>More energy.</strong>&nbsp;Increasing your heart rate several times a week will give you more get-up-and-go. Start off with just a few minutes of exercise per day, and increase your workout as you feel more energized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Stronger resilience.</strong>&nbsp;When faced with mental or emotional challenges in life, exercise can help you&nbsp;build resilience&nbsp;and cope in a healthy way, instead of resorting to alcohol, drugs, or other negative behaviors that ultimately only make your symptoms worse. Regular exercise can also help boost your immune system and reduce the impact of stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Reaping the mental health benefits of exercise is easier than you think</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You don&rsquo;t need to devote hours out of your busy day to train at the gym, sweat buckets, or run mile after monotonous mile to reap all the physical and mental health benefits of exercise. Just 30-minutes of moderate exercise five times a week is enough. And even that can be broken down into two 15-minute or even three 10-minute exercise sessions if that&rsquo;s easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Even a little bit of activity is better than nothing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you don&rsquo;t have time for 15 or 30 minutes of exercise, or if your body tells you to take a break after 5 or 10 minutes, for example, that&rsquo;s okay, too. Start with 5- or 10-minute sessions and slowly increase your time. The more you exercise, the more energy you&rsquo;ll have, so eventually you&rsquo;ll feel ready for a little more. The key is to commit to some moderate physical activity&mdash;however little&mdash;on most days. As exercising becomes a habit, you can slowly add extra minutes or try different types of activities. If you keep at it, the benefits of exercise will begin to pay off.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Overcoming obstacles to exercise</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Even when you know that exercise will help you feel better, taking that first step is still easier said than done. Obstacles to exercising are very real&mdash;particularly when you&rsquo;re also struggling with a mental health issue.Here are some common barriers and how you can get past them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Feeling exhausted.</strong>&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re tired, depressed, or stressed, it seems that working out will just make you feel worse. But the truth is that physical activity is a powerful energizer. Studies show that regular exercise can dramatically reduce fatigue and increase your energy levels. If you are really feeling tired, promise yourself a quick, 5-minute walk. Chances are, once you get moving you&rsquo;ll have more energy and be able to walk for longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Feeling exhausted.</strong>&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re tired, depressed, or stressed, it seems that working out will just make you feel worse.

Chances are, once you get moving you&rsquo;ll have more energy and be able to walk for longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Feeling bad about yourself.&nbsp;</strong>Are you your own worst critic? It&rsquo;s time to try a new way of thinking about your body. No matter your weight, age or fitness level, there are plenty of others in the same boat. Ask a friend to exercise with you. Accomplishing even the smallest fitness goals will help you gain body confidence and improve how you think about yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Feeling pain.</strong>&nbsp;If you have a disability, severe weight problem, arthritis, or any injury or illness that limits your mobility, talk to your doctor&nbsp;about<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/chair-exercises-and-limited-mobility-fitness.htm"> </a>ways to safely exercise. You shouldn&rsquo;t ignore pain, but rather do what you can, when you can. Divide your exercise into shorter, more frequent chunks of time if that helps, or try exercising in water to reduce joint or muscle discomfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Getting started with exercise when you have a mental health issue</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Many of us find it hard enough to motivate ourselves to exercise at the best of times. But when you feel depressed, anxious, stressed or have another mental health problem, it can seem doubly difficult.&nbsp;You know exercise will make you feel better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Start small.</strong>&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re under the cloud of anxiety or depression and haven&rsquo;t exercised for a long time, setting extravagant goals like completing a marathon or working out for an hour every morning will only leave you more despondent if you fall short. Better to set achievable goals and build up from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Schedule workouts when your energy is highest.</strong>&nbsp;Perhaps you have most energy first thing in the morning before work or school or at lunchtime before the mid-afternoon lull hits? Or maybe you do better exercising for longer at the weekends. If depression or anxiety has you feeling tired and unmotivated all day long, try dancing to some music or simply going for a walk. Even a short, 15-minute walk can help clear your mind, improve your mood, and boost your energy level. As you move and start to feel a little better, you&rsquo;ll often boost your energy enough to exercise more vigorously&mdash;by walking further, breaking into a run, or adding a bike ride, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Focus on activities you enjoy.</strong>&nbsp;Any activity that gets you moving counts. That could include throwing a Frisbee with a dog or friend, walking laps of a mall window shopping, or cycling to the grocery store. If you&rsquo;ve never exercised before or don&rsquo;t know what you might enjoy, try a few different things. Activities such as gardening or tackling a home improvement project can be great ways to start moving more when you have a mood disorder&mdash;as well as helping you become more active, they can also leave you with a sense of purpose and accomplishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Be comfortable.</strong>&nbsp;Wear clothing that&rsquo;s comfortable and choose a setting that you find calming or energizing. That may be a quiet corner of your home, a scenic path, or your favorite city park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Reward yourself.</strong>&nbsp;Part of the reward of completing an activity is how much better you&rsquo;ll feel afterwards, but it always helps your motivation to promise yourself an extra treat for exercising. Reward yourself with a hot bubble bath after a workout, a delicious smoothie,&nbsp;for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make exercise a social activity.</strong>&nbsp;Exercising with a friend or loved one,&nbsp;will not only make exercising more fun and enjoyable, it can also help motivate you to stick to a workout routine. You&rsquo;ll also feel better than if you were exercising alone. In fact, when you&rsquo;re suffering from a mood disorder such as depression, the companionship can be just as important as the exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make exercise a fun part of your everyday life</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">These tips can help you&nbsp;find activities you enjoy&nbsp;and start to feel better, look better, and get more out of life.</p>\r\n');

It involves observing how the food makes you feel and the signals your body sends about taste, satisfaction, and fullness. Mindful eating requires you to simply acknowledge and accept rather than judge the feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations you observe. It can extend to the process of buying, preparing, and serving your food as well as consuming it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For many of us, our busy daily lives often make mealtimes rushed affairs. We find ourselves eating in the car commuting to work, at the desk in front of a computer screen, or parked on the couch watching TV. We eat mindlessly, shoveling food down regardless of whether we&rsquo;re still hungry or not. In fact, we often eat for reasons other than hunger&mdash;to satisfy emotional needs, to relieve stress, or cope with unpleasant emotions such as sadness, anxiety, loneliness, or boredom. Mindful eating is the opposite of this kind of unhealthy &ldquo;mindless&rdquo; eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Mindful eating isn&rsquo;t about being perfect, always eating the right things, or never allowing yourself to eat on-the-go again. And it&rsquo;s not about establishing strict rules for how many calories you can eat or which foods you have to include or avoid in your diet. Rather, it&rsquo;s about focusing all your senses and being present as you shop for, cook, serve, and eat your food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While mindfulness isn&rsquo;t for everyone, many people find that by eating this way, even for just a few meals a week, you can become more attuned to your body.&nbsp;This can help you to avoid overeating, make it easier to change your dietary habits for the better, and enjoy the improved well-being that comes with a healthier diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Benefits of mindful eating</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">By paying close attention to how you feel as you eat&mdash;the texture and tastes of each mouthful, your body&rsquo;s hunger and fullness signals, how different foods affect your energy and mood&mdash;you can learn to savor both your food and the experience of eating. Being mindful of the food you eat can promote better digestion, keep you full with less food, and influence wiser choices about what you eat in the future. It can also help you free yourself from unhealthy habits around food and eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Eating mindfully can help you to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Slow down and take a break from the hustle and bustle of your day, easing stress and&nbsp;anxiety.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Examine and change your relationship with food&mdash;helping you to notice when you turn to food for reasons other than hunger, for example.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Derive greater pleasure from the food you eat, as you learn to slow down and more fully appreciate your meals and snacks.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Make healthier choices about what you eat by focusing on how each type of food makes you feel after eating it.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Improve your digestion by eating slower.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Feel fuller sooner and by eating less food.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Make a greater connection to where your food comes from, how it&rsquo;s produced, and the journey it&rsquo;s taken to your plate.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Eat in a healthier, more balanced way.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How to practice mindful eating</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">To&nbsp;practice mindfulness, you need to participate in an activity with total awareness. In the case of mindful eating, it&rsquo;s important to eat with all your attention rather than on &ldquo;automatic pilot&rdquo; or while you&rsquo;re reading, looking at your phone, watching TV, daydreaming, or planning what you&rsquo;re doing later. When your attention strays, gently bring it back to your food and the experience of cooking, serving, and eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Try practicing mindful eating for short, five-minute periods at first and gradually build up from there. And remember: you can begin mindful eating when you&rsquo;re making your shopping list or browsing the menu at a restaurant. Carefully assess each item you add to your list or choose from the menu.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Start by taking a few deep breaths and considering the health value&nbsp;</strong>of each different piece of food. While nutrition experts continually debate exactly which foods are &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; and which are not, the best rule of thumb is to eat food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employ all your senses</strong>&nbsp;while you&rsquo;re shopping, cooking, serving, and eating your food. How do different foods look, smell, and feel as you chop? How do they sound as they&rsquo;re being cooked? How do they taste as you eat?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Be curious and make observations</strong>&nbsp;about yourself, as well as the food you&rsquo;re about to eat. Notice how you&rsquo;re sitting, sit with good posture but remain relaxed. Acknowledge your surroundings but learn to tune them out. Focusing on what&rsquo;s going on around you can distract you from the process of eating and take away from the mindfulness experience.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tune into your hunger.</strong>&nbsp;How hungry are you? You want to come to the table when you&rsquo;re hungry, but not ravenous after skipping meals. Know what your intentions are in eating this specific meal. Are you eating because you&rsquo;re actually hungry or is it that you&rsquo;re bored, need a distraction, or think it&rsquo;s what you should be doing?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>With the food in front of you, take a moment to appreciate it</strong>&mdash;and any people you&rsquo;re sharing the meal with&mdash;before eating. Pay attention to the textures, shapes, colors and smells of the food. What reactions do you have to the food, and how do the smells make you feel?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Take a bite, and notice how it feels in your mouth</strong>. How would you describe the texture now? Try to identify all the ingredients, all the different flavors. Chew thoroughly and notice how you chew and what that feels like.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Focus on how your experience shifts moment to moment.</strong>&nbsp;Do you feel yourself getting full? Are you satisfied? Take your time, stay present and don&rsquo;t rush the experience.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Put your utensils down between bites</strong>. Take time to consider how you feel&mdash;hungry, satiated&mdash;before picking up your utensils again. Listen to your stomach, not your plate. Know when you&rsquo;re full and stop eating.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Give gratitude and reflect on where this food came from</strong>, the plants or animals involved, and all the people it took to transport the food and bring it onto your plate. Being more mindful about the origins of our food can help us all make wiser and more sustainable choices.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Continue to eat slowly</strong>&nbsp;as you talk with your dining companions, paying close attention to your body&rsquo;s signals of fullness. If eating alone, try to stay present to the experience of consuming the food.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Fitting mindful eating into your life</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For most of us, it&rsquo;s unrealistic to think we can be mindful for every bite or even for every meal we eat. The pressures of work and family sometimes mean you&rsquo;re forced to eat on the go or have only a limited window to eat something or risk going hungry for the rest of the day. But even when you can&rsquo;t adhere to a strict mindful eating practice, you can still avoid eating mindlessly and ignoring your body&rsquo;s signals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Perhaps you can take a few deep breaths before eating a meal or snack to quietly contemplate what you&rsquo;re about to put into your body. Are you eating in response to hunger signals or are you eating in response to an emotional signal? Maybe you&rsquo;re bored or anxious or lonely?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Similarly, are you eating food that is nutritionally healthy or are you eating food that is emotionally comforting? Even if you have to eat at your desk, for example, can you take a few moments to focus all your attention on your food, rather than multitasking or being distracted by your computer or phone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Think of mindful eating like exercise: every little bit counts. The more you can do to slow down, focus solely on the process of eating, and listen to your body, the greater satisfaction you&rsquo;ll experience from your food and the greater control you&rsquo;ll have over your&nbsp;diet and nutrition habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td colspan="2">Making the switch from mindless to mindful eating</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Mindless eating:</td>\r\n			<td>Mindful eating:</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Eating on autopilot or while multitasking (driving, working, reading, watching TV, etc.).</td>\r\n			<td>Focusing all your attention on your food and the experience of eating.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Eating to fill an emotional void (because you&rsquo;re stressed, lonely, sad, or bored, for example).</td>\r\n			<td>Eating only to satisfy physical hunger.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Eating junk or comfort food.</td>\r\n			<td>Eating nutritionally healthy meals and snacks.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Eating food as quickly as possible.</td>\r\n			<td>Eating slowly, savoring every bite.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Eating until all the food has gone, ignoring your body&rsquo;s signals of fullness.</td>\r\n			<td>Listening to your body&rsquo;s signals and eating only until you&rsquo;re full.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Eating to fill a void vs. eating to improve well-being</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While eating undoubtedly affects how you feel, it&rsquo;s also very true that how you feel affects what, when, and how much you eat. Many of us frequently mistake feelings of anxiety, stress, loneliness, or boredom for hunger pangs and use food in an attempt to cope with these feelings. The discomfort you feel reminds you that you want something,&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;something to fill a void in your life. That void could be a better relationship, a more fulfilling job, or a spiritual need. When you continually try to fill that void with food, though, you inevitably overlook your real hungers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As you practice mindful eating and your awareness grows, you&rsquo;ll become aware of how often your food consumption has nothing to do with physical hunger, and everything to do with filling an emotional need. As you sit down to eat, ask yourself, &ldquo;What am I truly hungry for?&rdquo; Are you craving that &ldquo;little something to nibble on&rdquo; because you&rsquo;re genuinely hungry or for another reason?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Filling and saturating yourself with food can help mask what you&rsquo;re really hungry for, but only for a short time. And then the real hunger or need will return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Practicing mindful eating forces you to slow down, focus on the present moment, and notice what you&rsquo;re really feeling.&nbsp; And when you repeatedly ask yourself, &ldquo;How well do I feel after a meal or snack?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll begin the process of gaining awareness of your own specific nutritional needs. You&rsquo;ll measure meals and snacks in terms of how they affect your well-being. Your purpose for eating will shift from the intention of feeling full of food, to the intention of feeling full of energy and vitality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Taking deep breaths before you eat</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Breathing deeply can often help to pacify hunger, especially when that hunger really isn&rsquo;t about food. Oxygen fuels the body and breathing deeply can increase your energy and sense of well-being. As you breathe deeply, you also&nbsp;relax and relieve stress and tension, common imitators of false hunger.</p>\r\n'),
(6, 'High-Fiber Foods', 'uploads/heal eating2.jpg', 'Healthy Eating', '2021-06-03 08:40:07', '<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">What is fiber?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Many of us associate fiber with digestive health and bowel function. But eating foods high in dietary fiber can do so much more than keep you regular. It can lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, improve the health of your skin, and help you lose weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Fiber, also known as roughage, is the part of plant-based foods (grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and beans) that the body can&rsquo;t break down. It passes through the body undigested, keeping your digestive system clean and healthy, flushing cholesterol and harmful carcinogens out of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Fiber comes in two varieties:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1. Insoluble fiber</strong>&nbsp;does not dissolve in water. It is the bulky fiber that helps to prevent constipation, and is found in whole grains, wheat cereals, and vegetables such as carrots, celery, and tomatoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Soluble fiber</strong>&nbsp;dissolves in water and helps control blood sugar levels and reduce cholesterol. Good sources include barley, oatmeal, beans, nuts, and fruits such as apples, berries, citrus fruits, and pears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Many foods contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. In general, the more natural and unprocessed the food, the higher it is in fiber. There is no fiber in meat, dairy, or sugar. Refined or &ldquo;white&rdquo; foods, such as white bread, white rice, and pastries, have had all or most of their fiber removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">The health benefits of fiber</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Fiber offers a healthy and effective way to stay regular, but that&rsquo;s not the only reason why we should be including more in our diets. Many different studies have highlighted how eating a diet high in fiber can boost your immune system and overall health, and improve how you look and feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Some of the benefits include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Digestive health.</strong>&nbsp;Dietary fiber normalizes bowel movements by bulking up stools and making them easier to pass. This can help relieve and prevent both constipation and diarrhea. Eating plenty of fiber can also reduce your risk for diverticulitis (inflammation of the intestine), hemorrhoids, gallstones, kidney stones, and provide some relief for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some studies have also indicated that a high-fiber diet may help to lower gastric acid and reduce your risk for gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) and ulcers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Diabetes.&nbsp;</strong>A diet high in fiber&mdash;particularly insoluble fiber from cereals&mdash;can lower your risk for type 2 diabetes. If you&nbsp;already have diabetes, eating soluble fiber can slow the absorption of sugar and improve your blood sugar levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cancer.</strong>&nbsp;There is some research that suggests eating a high-fiber diet can help prevent colorectal cancer, although the evidence is not yet conclusive. Diets rich in high-fiber foods are also linked to a&nbsp;lower risk for other common digestive system cancers, including stomach, mouth, and pharynx.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Skin health.</strong>&nbsp;When yeast and fungus are excreted through the skin, they can trigger outbreaks or acne. Eating fiber, especially psyllium husk (a type of plant seed), can flush toxins out of your body, improving the health and appearance of your skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Heart health.&nbsp;</strong>Fiber, particularly soluble fiber, is an important element of any&nbsp;heart-healthy diet. Eating a diet high in fiber can improve cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol. A high fiber intake can also reduce your risk for metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors linked to coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Fiber can also help to&nbsp;lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, improve levels of HDL (good) cholesterol, and shed excess weight around the abdomen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fiber and weight loss</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As well as aiding digestion and preventing constipation, fiber adds bulk to your diet, a key factor in both&nbsp;losing weigh<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/diets/how-to-lose-weight-and-keep-it-off.htm">t</a>&nbsp;and maintaining a healthy weight. Adding bulk can help you feel full sooner. Since fiber stays in the stomach longer than other foods, that feeling of fullness will stay with you much longer, helping you to eat less. High-fiber foods such as fruits and vegetables tend to be low in calories, so by adding fiber to your diet, it&rsquo;s easier to cut calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">There are other ways that a high fiber intake can aid weight loss:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">By regulating your blood sugar levels, it can help maintain your body&rsquo;s fat-burning capacity and avoid insulin spikes that leave you feeling drained and craving unhealthy foods.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Eating plenty of fiber can move fat through your digestive system at a faster rate so that less of it can be absorbed.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">When you fill up on high-fiber foods such as fruit, you&rsquo;ll also have more energy for exercising.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tips for adding fiber to your diet</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Depending on your age and gender, nutrition experts recommend you eat at least 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day for optimal health. Research suggests that most of us aren&rsquo;t eating half that amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While hitting your daily target may seem overwhelming at first, by filling up on whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and whole grains you can get the fiber you need to start reaping the health benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fiber from whole grains</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Refined or processed foods are lower in fiber content, so try to make whole grains an integral part of your diet. There are many simple ways to add whole grains to your meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Start your day with fiber.&nbsp;</strong>Look for whole grain cereals to boost your fiber intake at breakfast. Simply switching your breakfast cereal from Corn Flakes to Bran Flakes can add an extra 6 grams of fiber to your diet; switching to All-Bran or Fiber-One will boost it even more. If those cereals aren&rsquo;t to your liking, try adding a few tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran to your favorite cereal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with brown rice and whole grain products.&nbsp;</strong>Experiment with wild rice, barley, whole-wheat pasta, and bulgur. These alternatives are higher in fiber than their more mainstream counterparts&mdash;and you may find you love their tastes. Choose whole grain bread for toast and sandwiches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Bulk up your baking.</strong>&nbsp;When&nbsp;baking at home, substitute whole-grain flour for half or all of the white flour, since whole-grain flour is heavier than white flour. In yeast breads, use a bit more yeast or let the dough rise longer. Try adding crushed bran cereal or unprocessed wheat bran to muffins, cakes, and cookies. Or add psyllium husk to gluten-free baked goods, such as breads, pizza dough, and pasta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Add flaxseed.</strong>&nbsp;Flaxseeds are small brown seeds that are high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower your total blood cholesterol. You can grind the seeds in a coffee grinder or food processor and add to yogurt, applesauce, or breakfast cereals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fiber from fruit and vegetables</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Most fruits and vegetables are high in fiber, another good reason to include more in your daily diet. Here are some simple strategies that can help:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Add fruit to your breakfast.&nbsp;</strong>Berries are high in fiber, so try adding fresh blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, or blackberries to your morning cereal or yoghurt</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Keep fruit and vegetables at your fingertips.</strong>&nbsp;Wash and cut fruit and veggies and put them in your refrigerator for quick and healthy snacks. Choose recipes that feature these high-fiber ingredients, like veggie stir-fries or fruit salad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juice.</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get more fiber and consume fewer calories. An 8oz. glass of orange juice, for example, contains almost no fiber and about 110 calories, while one medium fresh orange contains about 3g of fiber and only 60 calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat the peel.&nbsp;</strong>Peeling can reduce the amount of fiber in fruits and vegetables, so eat the peel of fruits such as apples and pears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Bulk up soups and salads.&nbsp;</strong>Liven up a dull salad by adding nuts, seeds, kidney beans, peas, or black beans. Artichokes are also very high in fiber and can be added to salads or eaten as a snack. Beans, peas, lentils, and rice make tasty high-fiber additions to soups and stews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make snacks count.</strong>&nbsp;Fresh and dried fruit, raw vegetables, and whole-grain crackers are all good ways to add fiber at snack time. A handful of nuts can also make a healthy, high-fiber snack.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Making the switch to a high-fiber diet</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;re new to eating high-fiber foods, it&rsquo;s best to start by&nbsp;gradually adding fiber to your diet and increasing your water intake. Fiber absorbs water so the more fiber you add to your diet, the more fluids you should drink. Suddenly adding a large amount of fiber to your diet can sometimes cause side effects such as abdominal cramps, intestinal gas, bloating, or diarrhea. These should go away once your digestive system becomes used to the increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Fiber in fast food</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Fast food is often cheap and convenient, but finding a healthy meal with enough fiber can be a challenge. Many&nbsp;fast food meals&nbsp;are packed with calories, sodium, and unhealthy fat with little or no dietary fiber. Even a seemingly healthy salad from a fast food restaurant is often light on fiber&mdash;simple lettuce greens provide only about 0.5 grams of fiber per cup. Look for salads that include other vegetables, and whenever possible, up the fiber content by adding your own nuts, beans, or corn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Fiber supplements</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While the best way to get fiber in your diet is from foods naturally rich in fiber&mdash;fruit, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts&mdash;when that proves difficult, taking a fiber supplement can help make up the shortfall. Supplements can also be useful to top up your daily intake while you transition to a high-fiber diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Fiber supplements come in a variety of forms, including powders you dissolve in water or add to food, chewable tablets, and wafers. However, there are some drawbacks to getting your fiber from supplements instead of fiber-rich foods:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fiber supplements won&rsquo;t provide the same vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients offered by high-fiber foods.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Supplements won&rsquo;t fill you up or help you manage your weight.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fiber supplements can interact with some medications, including certain&nbsp;antidepressants, cholesterol-lowering medications, and the anticoagulant drug warfarin. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions before taking a supplement.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">If you have diabetes, fiber supplements may also reduce your blood sugar levels so, again, check with your healthcare provider before adding supplements to your diet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you decide to take a fiber supplement, start with small amounts and gradually build up to avoid any abdominal bloating and gas, and drink plenty of fluids.</p>\r\n'),

But the right food can not only improve your mood, boost your energy, and help you maintain a healthy weight, it can also support you through the different stages in a woman&rsquo;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As women, many of us are frequently prone to neglecting our own dietary needs. You may feel that you&rsquo;re too busy to eat well or used to putting the needs of your family before your own. Or perhaps you&rsquo;re trying to stick to an extreme diet that leaves you short on vital nutrients and feeling cranky, hungry, and low on energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Women&rsquo;s specific needs are often neglected by dietary research, too. Nutritional studies tend to rely on male subjects whose hormone levels are more stable and predictable, thus sometimes making the results irrelevant or even misleading to women&rsquo;s needs. All this can add up to serious shortfalls in your daily nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While what works best for one woman may not always be the best choice for another, the important thing is to build your diet around your vital nutritional needs. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to improve your energy and mood, combat stress or PMS, boost fertility, enjoy a healthy pregnancy, or ease the symptoms of menopause, these nutrition tips can help you to stay healthy, active, and vibrant throughout your ever-changing life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How women&rsquo;s nutritional needs differ from men&rsquo;s</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As children, boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; dietary needs are largely similar. But when puberty begins, women start to develop unique nutritional requirements. And as we age and our bodies go through more physical and hormonal changes, so our nutritional needs continue to evolve, making it important that our diets evolve to meet these changing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While women tend to need fewer calories than men, our requirements for certain vitamins and minerals are much higher. Hormonal changes associated with menstruation, child-bearing, and menopause mean that women have a higher risk of anemia, weakened bones, and osteoporosis, requiring a higher intake of nutrients such as iron, calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin B9 (folate).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Calcium for strong bones throughout life</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Among other things, you need calcium to build healthy bones and teeth, keep them strong as you age, regulate the heart&rsquo;s rhythm, and ensure your nervous system functions properly. Calcium deficiency can lead to, or exacerbate, mood problems such as irritability, anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. If you don&rsquo;t get enough calcium in your diet, your body will take calcium from your bones to ensure normal cell function, which can lead to weakened bones or osteoporosis. Women are at a greater risk than men of developing osteoporosis, so it&rsquo;s important to get plenty of calcium, in combination with magnesium and vitamin D, to support your bone health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>How much calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D do you need?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Calcium:</strong>&nbsp;For adult women aged 19-50, daily allowance is 1,000 mg/day.&nbsp;For women over 50, the&nbsp;daily allowance is 1,200 mg/day.&nbsp;Good sources of calcium include dairy products, leafy green vegetables, certain fish, grains, tofu, cabbage, and summer squash. Your body cannot take in more than 500 mg at any one time and there&rsquo;s no benefit to exceeding the recommended daily amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Magnesium:</strong>&nbsp;Magnesium increases calcium absorption form the blood into the bone. In fact, your body can&rsquo;t utilize calcium without it.&nbsp;The<em> </em>daily allowance for magnesium is 320 to 400 mg/day.&nbsp;Good sources include leafy green vegetables, summer squash, broccoli, cucumber, green beans, and a variety of seeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Vitamin D:</strong>&nbsp;Vitamin D is also crucial to the proper metabolism of calcium.&nbsp;Aim for 600 IU (international units) daily.&nbsp;You can get Vitamin D from about half an hour of direct sunlight, and from foods such as salmon, vitamin-D fortified milk, and eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Should you avoid dairy because of its saturated fat content?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Some of the best sources of calcium are dairy products. However, dairy products such as whole milk, cheese, and yogurt also tend to contain high levels of saturated fat. Limiting your saturated fat intake to no more than 10% of your daily calories, meaning you can enjoy whole milk dairy in moderation and opt for no- or low-fat dairy products when possible. Just be aware that reduced fat dairy products often contain lots of added sugar, which can have negative effects on both your health and waistline.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Iron: why you may not be getting enough</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Iron helps to create the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. It&rsquo;s also important to maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails. Due to the amount of blood lost during menstruation, women of childbearing age need more than twice the amount of iron that men do&mdash;even more during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, many of us aren&rsquo;t getting nearly enough iron in our diets, making iron deficiency anemia the most common deficiency in women. Anemia can deplete your energy, leaving you feeling weak, exhausted, and out of breath after even minimal physical activity. Iron deficiency can also impact your mood, causing depression-like symptoms such as irritability and difficulty concentrating. While a simple blood test can tell your doctor if you have an iron deficiency, if you&rsquo;re feeling tired and cranky all the time, it&rsquo;s a good idea to examine the amount of iron in your diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>How much iron do you need?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For adolescent women aged 14-18, the daily amount is 15 mg (27 mg if pregnant, 10 mg if lactating). For adult women aged 19-50,&nbsp;18 mg/day. For women 51+ years old, the recommended daily amount is 8 mg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Part of the reason why so many women fail to get the amount of iron they need is because one of the best sources of iron is red meat (especially liver) which also contains high levels of saturated fat. While leafy green vegetables and beans are also good sources of iron&mdash;and don&rsquo;t contain high levels saturated fat&mdash;the iron from plant foods is different to the iron from animal sources, and not absorbed as well by the body. Other foods rich in iron include poultry, seafood, dried fruit such as raisins and apricots, and iron-fortified cereals, breads, and pastas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">The importance of folate (vitamin B9) for women of child-bearing age</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Folate or vitamin B9 (also known as folic acid when used in fortified foods or taken as a supplement) is another nutrient that many women don&rsquo;t get enough of in their diets. Folate can greatly reduce the chance of neurological birth defects when taken before conception and during the first few weeks of pregnancy. Folate can also lower a woman&rsquo;s risk for heart disease and certain types of cancer, so even if you&rsquo;re not planning on getting pregnant (and many pregnancies are unplanned), it&rsquo;s an essential nutrient for every woman of childbearing age. In later life, folate can help your body manufacture estrogen during menopause. Not getting enough folate in your diet can also impact your mood, leaving you feeling irritable and fatigued, affecting your concentration, and making you more susceptible to depression and headaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>How much folate do you need?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><em>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that all women and teen girls who could become pregnant consume 400 mcg (micrograms) of folate or folic acid daily. Women who are pregnant should take 600 mcg, and those breastfeeding 500 mcg.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Good sources include leafy green vegetables, fruit and fruit juice, nuts, beans and peas. Folic acid is also added to enrich many grain-based products such as cereals, bread, and pasta.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Healthy eating for pregnant or breastfeeding women</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You only need about 300 extra calories per day to provide sufficient nutrition for your growing baby. However, gaining some weight is natural during pregnancy, and nursing can help with weight loss after the baby is born.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Pregnancy diet tips</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong>&nbsp;are essential for the neurological and early visual development of your baby and for making breast milk after birth. Aim for two weekly servings of cold water fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, herring, or anchovies. Sardines are widely considered the safest and most sustainable fish to eat, while seaweed is a rich vegetarian source of Omega-3s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Abstain from alcohol.</strong>&nbsp;No amount is safe for the baby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cut down on caffeine</strong>, which has been linked to a higher risk of miscarriage and can interfere with iron absorption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat smaller, more frequent meals</strong>&nbsp;rather than a few large ones. This will help prevent and reduce morning sickness and heartburn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Be cautious about foods that may be harmful to pregnant women.</strong>&nbsp;These include soft cheeses, sushi, deli meats, raw sprouts, and fish such as albacore tuna, swordfish, tilefish, and king mackerel that contain high levels of mercury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>High quality protein</strong>&nbsp;is also important to your baby&rsquo;s developing brain and nervous system. Opt for&nbsp;high-quality protein&nbsp;from fish, poultry, dairy, and plant-based protein sources rather than relying on just red meat.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Breastfeeding diet tips</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Keep your caloric consumption a little higher</strong>&nbsp;to help your body maintain a steady milk supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Emphasize healthy sources of protein and calcium</strong>, which are higher in demand during lactation. Nursing women need about 20 grams more high-quality protein a day than they did before pregnancy to support milk production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Take prenatal vitamin supplements</strong>, which are still helpful during breastfeeding, unless your physician tells you otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine.</strong>&nbsp;Just as with the pregnancy guidelines above,&nbsp;refrain from drinking&nbsp;and smoking, and reduce your caffeine intake.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Diet tips to ease the symptoms of menopause</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For up to a decade prior to menopause, your reproductive system prepares to retire and your body shifts its production of hormones. By eating especially well as you enter your menopausal years, you can ease common symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Boost calcium intake&nbsp;</strong>(along with vitamin D and magnesium) to support bone health and prevent osteoporosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Limit wine, sugar, white flour products, and coffee&nbsp;</strong>to ease hot flashes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat more good fats.&nbsp;</strong>Omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids&nbsp;can help boost hormone production and give your skin a healthy glow. Evening primrose oil and blackcurrant oil are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an essential fatty acid that can help balance your hormones and alleviate hot flashes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Try flaxseed for hot flashes.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Flaxseed is rich in lignans, which help stabilize hormone levels and manage hot flashes. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed to your daily diet. Try sprinkling it on soups, salads, or main dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat more soy.&nbsp;</strong>Soy products are high in phytoestrogens, plant-based estrogens that are similar to estrogen produced by the body. Some studies suggest that soy may help manage menopausal symptoms. Try natural soy sources such as soy milk, tofu, tempeh, and soy nuts.</p>\r\n');

So, what should you believe? The truth is there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution to permanent healthy weight loss. What works for one person may not work for you, since our bodies respond differently to different foods, depending on genetics and other health factors. To find the method of weight loss that&rsquo;s right for you will likely take time and require patience, commitment, and some experimentation with different foods and diets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While some people respond well to counting calories or similar restrictive methods, others respond better to having more freedom in planning their weight-loss programs. Being free to simply avoid fried foods or cut back on refined carbs can set them up for success. So, don&rsquo;t get too discouraged if a diet that worked for somebody else doesn&rsquo;t work for you. And don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if a diet proves too restrictive for you to stick with. Ultimately, a diet is only right for you if it&rsquo;s one you can stick with over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Three popular weight loss strategies</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>1. Cut calories</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Some experts believe that successfully managing your weight comes down to a simple equation: If you eat fewer calories than you burn, you lose weight. Sounds easy, right? Then why is losing weight so hard?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Weight loss isn&rsquo;t a linear event over time.</strong>&nbsp;When you cut calories, you may drop weight for the first few weeks, for example, and then something changes. You eat the same number of calories but you lose less weight or no weight at all. That&rsquo;s because when you lose weight you&rsquo;re losing water and lean tissue as well as fat, your metabolism slows, and your body changes in other ways. So, in order to continue dropping weight each week, you need to continue cutting calories.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A calorie isn&rsquo;t always a calorie.</strong>&nbsp;Eating 100 calories of high fructose corn syrup, for example, can have a different effect on your body than eating 100 calories of broccoli. The trick for sustained weight loss is to ditch the foods that are packed with calories but don&rsquo;t make you feel full (like candy) and replace them with foods that fill you up without being loaded with calories (like vegetables).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Cut carbs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A different way of viewing weight loss identifies the problem as not one of consuming too many calories, but rather the way the body accumulates fat after consuming carbohydrates&mdash;in particular the role of the hormone insulin. When you eat a meal, carbohydrates from the food enter your bloodstream as glucose. In order to keep your blood sugar levels in check, your body always burns off this glucose before it burns off fat from a meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you eat a carbohydrate-rich meal (lots of pasta, rice, bread, or French fries, for example), your body releases insulin to help with the influx of all this glucose into your blood. As well as regulating blood sugar levels, insulin does two things: It prevents your fat cells from releasing fat for the body to burn as fuel (because its priority is to burn off the glucose) and it creates more fat cells for storing everything that your body can&rsquo;t burn off. The result is that you gain weight and your body now requires more fuel to burn, so you eat more. Since insulin only burns carbohydrates, you crave carbs and so begins a vicious cycle of consuming carbs and gaining weight. To lose weight, the reasoning goes, you need to break this cycle&nbsp;by reducing carbs. If you do try a low-carb diet, you can reduce your risks and limit your intake of saturated and trans fats by choosing lean meats, fish and vegetarian sources of protein, low-fat dairy products, and eating plenty of leafy green and non-starchy vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. Cut fat</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It&rsquo;s a mainstay of many diets: if you don&rsquo;t want to get fat, don&rsquo;t eat fat. Walk down any grocery store aisle and you&rsquo;ll be bombarded with reduced-fat snacks, dairy, and packaged meals. But while our low-fat options have exploded, so have obesity rates. So, why haven&rsquo;t low-fat diets worked for more of us?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Not all fat is bad.</strong>&nbsp;Healthy or&nbsp;&ldquo;good&rdquo; fats&nbsp;can actually help to control your weight, as well as manage your moods and fight fatigue. Unsaturated fats found in avocados, nuts, seeds, soy milk, tofu, and fatty fish can help fill you up, while adding a little tasty olive oil to a plate of vegetables, for example, can make it easier to eat healthy food and improve the overall quality of your diet.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We often make the wrong trade-offs.</strong>&nbsp;Many of us make the mistake of swapping fat for the empty calories of sugar and refined carbohydrates. Instead of eating whole-fat yoghurt, for example, we eat low- or no-fat versions that are packed with sugar to make up for the loss of taste. Or we swap our fatty breakfast bacon for a muffin or donut that causes rapid spikes in blood sugar.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Control emotional eating</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">We don&rsquo;t always eat simply to satisfy hunger. All too often, we turn to food when we&rsquo;re stressed or anxious, which can wreck any diet and pack on the pounds. Do you eat when you&rsquo;re worried, bored, or lonely? Do you snack in front of the TV at the end of a stressful day? Recognizing your&nbsp;emotional eating&nbsp;triggers can make all the difference in your weight-loss efforts. If you eat when you&rsquo;re:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Stressed&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; find healthier ways to calm yourself. Try yoga, meditation, or soaking in a hot bath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Low on energy&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; find other mid-afternoon pick-me-ups. Try walking around the block, listening to energizing music, or taking a short nap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Lonely or bored&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; reach out to others instead of reaching for the refrigerator. Call a friend who makes you laugh, take your dog for a walk, or go to the library, mall, or park&mdash;anywhere there&rsquo;s people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Stay motivated</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Permanent weight loss requires making healthy changes to your lifestyle and food choices. To stay motivated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Set goals to keep you motivated.</strong>&nbsp;Short-term goals, like wanting to fit into a bikini for the summer, usually don&rsquo;t work as well as wanting to feel more confident or become healthier for your children&rsquo;s sakes. When temptation strikes, focus on the benefits you&rsquo;ll reap from being healthier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Use tools to track your progress.&nbsp;</strong>Smartphone apps, fitness trackers, or simply keeping a journal can help you keep track of the food you eat, the calories you burn, and the weight you lose. Seeing the results in black and white can help you stay motivated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Get plenty of sleep.</strong>&nbsp;Lack of sleep stimulates your appetite so you want more food than normal; at the same time, it stops you feeling satisfied, making you want to keep eating. Sleep deprivation can also affect your motivation, so aim for eight hours of&nbsp;quality sleep a night.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Cut down on sugar and refined carbs</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Whether or not you&rsquo;re specifically aiming to cut carbs, most of us consume unhealthy amounts of&nbsp;sugar and refined carbohydrates&nbsp;such as white bread, pizza dough, pasta, pastries, white flour, white rice, and sweetened breakfast cereals. Replacing refined carbs with their whole-grain counterparts and eliminating candy and desserts is only part of the solution, though. Sugar is hidden in foods as diverse as canned soups and vegetables, pasta sauce, margarine, and many reduced fat foods. Since your body gets all it needs from sugar naturally occurring in food, all this added sugar amounts to nothing but a lot of empty calories and unhealthy spikes in your blood glucose.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Fill up with fruit, veggies, and fiber</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Even if you&rsquo;re cutting calories, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you have to eat less food.&nbsp;High-fiber foods&nbsp;such as fruit, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are higher in volume and take longer to digest, making them filling&mdash;and great for weight-loss. It&rsquo;s generally okay to eat as much fresh fruit and non-starchy vegetables as you want&mdash;you&rsquo;ll feel full before you&rsquo;ve overdone it on the calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat vegetables raw or steamed</strong>, not fried or breaded, and dress them with herbs and spices or a little olive oil for flavor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Add fruit to low sugar cereal</strong>&mdash;blueberries, strawberries, sliced bananas. You&rsquo;ll still enjoy lots of sweetness, but with fewer calories, less sugar, and more fiber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Add more veggies to your favorite main courses</strong>&nbsp;to make your dish more substantial. Even pasta and stir-fries can be diet-friendly if you use less noodles and more vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Start your meal with salad or vegetable soup</strong>&nbsp;to help fill you up so you eat less of your entr&eacute;e.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Take charge of your food environment</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Set yourself up for weight-loss success by taking charge of your food environment: when you eat, how much you eat, and what foods you make easily available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cook your own meals at home.</strong>&nbsp;This allows you to control both portion size and what goes in to the food. Restaurant and packaged foods generally contain a lot more sugar, unhealthy fat, and calories than&nbsp;food cooked at home&mdash;plus the portion sizes tend to be larger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Serve yourself smaller portions.</strong>&nbsp;Use small plates, bowls, and cups to make your portions appear larger. Don&rsquo;t eat out of large bowls or directly from food containers, which makes it difficult to assess how much you&rsquo;ve eaten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat early.</strong>&nbsp;Studies suggest that consuming more of your daily calories at breakfast and fewer at dinner can help you drop more pounds. Eating a larger, healthy breakfast can jump-start your metabolism, stop you feeling hungry during the day, and give you more time to burn off the calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fast for 14 hours a day.</strong>&nbsp;Try to eat dinner earlier in the day and then fast until breakfast the next morning. Eating only when you&rsquo;re most active and giving your digestion a long break may aid weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time.</strong>&nbsp;You can create your own small portion snacks in plastic bags or containers. Eating on a schedule will help you avoid eating when you aren&rsquo;t truly hungry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Drink more water.</strong>&nbsp;Thirst can often be confused with hunger, so by drinking water you can avoid extra calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Limit the amount of tempting foods you have at home.</strong>&nbsp;If you share a kitchen with non-dieters, store indulgent foods out of sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Keeping the weight off</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The study has found that participants who&rsquo;ve been successful in maintaining their weight loss share some common strategies. Adopting these habits may help you to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;it off:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stay physically active</strong>. Exercise for about 60 minutes, typically walking.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Keep a food log</strong>. Recording what you eat every day helps to keep you accountable and motivated.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eat breakfast every day.&nbsp;</strong>Most commonly in the study, it&rsquo;s cereal and fruit. Eating breakfast boosts metabolism and staves off hunger later in the day.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eat more fiber and less unhealthy fat&nbsp;</strong>than the typical American diet.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Regularly check the scale</strong>. Weighing yourself weekly may help you to detect any small gains in weight, enabling you to promptly take corrective action before the problem escalates.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Watch less television</strong>. Cutting back on the time spent sitting in front of a screen can be a key part of adopting a more active lifestyle and preventing weight gain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n'),

Those extra pounds put kids at risk for developing serious health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. Childhood obesity also takes an emotional toll. Overweight children often have trouble keeping up with other kids and joining in sports and activities. Other kids may tease and exclude them, leading to low self-esteem, negative body image, and even&nbsp;depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;re watching your child struggle with their weight, it&rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed or helpless. But there&rsquo;s plenty you can do to help your child. Diagnosing weight problems and obesity as early as possible can reduce your child&rsquo;s risk of developing serious medical conditions as they get older. And by getting the whole family involved, you can break the cycle of weight problems and obesity, boost your child&rsquo;s physical and mental health, and help them establish a healthy relationship with food that will last a lifetime. Whatever your child&rsquo;s weight, let them know that you love them and that all you want to do is help them be healthy and happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Causes of weight problems and obesity in children</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Most cases of childhood obesity are caused by eating too much and exercising too little.&nbsp;When they take in more calories than they burn throughout the day, it can result in weight gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Causes of weight problems in children may include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Busy families cooking at home less and eating out more.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Easy access to cheap, high-calorie&nbsp;junk food.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Kids consuming huge amounts of sugar in sweetened drinks and hidden in an array of foods.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Kids spending less time actively playing outside, and more time watching TV&nbsp;and sitting at the computer.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Many schools eliminating or cutting back their physical education programs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">To combat weight problems, get the whole family involved</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Healthy habits start at home. The best way to fight or prevent childhood obesity and weight problems is to get the whole family on a healthier track. Making better food choices and becoming more active will benefit everyone, regardless of weight. Spending time with your kids&mdash;talking about their day, playing, reading, cooking&mdash;can supply them with the self-esteem boost they may need to make positive changes. If your child sees you eating your vegetables, being active, and limiting your TV time, there&rsquo;s a good chance that they will do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>What you eat.</strong>&nbsp;Tell your child about the&nbsp;healthy food&nbsp;you are eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>When you cook.</strong>&nbsp;Cook healthily in front of your children. Tell them about what you&rsquo;re making and why it&rsquo;s good for your body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>How you move.</strong>&nbsp;Exercise&nbsp;in some way every day. Tell your kids what you&rsquo;re doing, and invite them to join you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Your free time.</strong>&nbsp;Avoid the television or too much computer time. Kids are much less likely to turn screens on if they are off and you are doing something they can get involved in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Make healthier food choices</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Start by making small, gradual steps towards&nbsp;healthy eating&mdash;like adding a salad to dinner every night or swapping out French fries for steamed vegetables&mdash;rather than one big drastic switch. As small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat the rainbow.</strong>&nbsp;Serve and encourage consumption of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. This should include red (beets, tomatoes), orange (carrots, squash), yellow (potatoes, bananas), green (lettuce, broccoli) and so on&mdash;just like eating a rainbow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make breakfast a priority.&nbsp;</strong>Children who eat breakfast are less likely to be overweight or obese than those who skip the first meal of the day. It&rsquo;s important to focus on healthy choices, though, like oatmeal, fresh fruit, whole grain cereal high in fiber and low in sugar, and low-fat milk instead of sugary cereals, donuts, or toaster pastries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Look for hidden sugar.</strong>&nbsp;Reducing the amount of&nbsp;candy and desserts&nbsp;you and your child eat is only part of the battle. Sugar is also hidden in foods as diverse as bread, canned soups, pasta sauce, instant mashed potatoes, frozen dinners, low-fat meals, fast food, and ketchup. Check labels and opt for low sugar products and use fresh or frozen ingredients instead of canned goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Don&rsquo;t go no fat, go good fat</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Not all fats contribute to weight gain. So instead of trying to cut out fat from your child&rsquo;s diet, focus on replacing&nbsp;unhealthy fats with healthy fats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Avoid trans fats</strong>&nbsp;that are dangerous to your child&rsquo;s health. Check labels on commercially-baked goods, packaged snack foods, and fried foods, and avoid anything with &ldquo;partially hydrogenated&rdquo; oil in the ingredients, even if it claims to be trans fat-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Choose saturated fat wisely.&nbsp;</strong>Focus on the source of saturated fats consumed: A glass of whole milk or natural cheese rather than a hot dog, donut, or pastry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Add more healthy fats</strong>&nbsp;that can help a child control blood sugar and avoid diabetes. Unsaturated or &ldquo;good&rdquo; fats include avocados, olive oil, nuts, fatty fish, soy, tofu, or flaxseed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Be smart about snacks and sweet food</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Your home is where your child most likely eats the majority of meals and snacks, so it is vital that your kitchen is stocked with healthy choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Don&rsquo;t ban sweets entirely.</strong>&nbsp;While many kids&rsquo; consume too much sugar, having a no sweets rule is an invitation for cravings and overindulging when given the chance. Instead, limit the cookies, candies, and baked goods your child eats and introduce fruit-based snacks and desserts instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Go for reduced-sugar options.&nbsp;</strong>When buying foods such as syrups, jellies, and sauces, opt for products labeled &ldquo;reduced sugar&rdquo; or &ldquo;no added sugar.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Focus on fruit.</strong>&nbsp;Keep a bowl of fruit out for your children to snack on. And offer fruit as a sweet treat&mdash;frozen juice bars, fruit smoothies, strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream, fresh fruit added to plain yogurt, or sliced apples with peanut butter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Check the sugar content of your kid&rsquo;s cereal.</strong>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a huge disparity in the amount of added sugar between different brands of cereal. Some cereals are more than 50% sugar by weight. Try mixing a low sugar, high-fiber cereal with your child&rsquo;s favorite sweetened cereal, or add&nbsp;dried fruit to oatmeal for a natural sweet taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">Get your kids moving</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Children who sit too much and move too little are at the highest risk for becoming overweight. Kids need&nbsp;an hour of exercise a day&nbsp;for optimum health. This may seem like a lot, but exercise doesn&rsquo;t have to happen in a gym or all at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Exercise ideas for kids</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Play active indoor games.</strong>&nbsp;Put the remote away and organize some active indoor games. You can play tag (perhaps crawling tag, so that you keep messes to a minimum), hide-and-seek, or Simon Says (think jumping jacks and stretches).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Try activity-based video games</strong>, such as those from Wii and Kinect which are played standing up and moving around&mdash;simulating dancing, skateboarding, soccer, bowling, or tennis. Once your child gains in confidence, get away from the screen and play the real thing outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Get active outside with your child.</strong>&nbsp;Take a walk together, bike around the neighborhood, explore a local park, visit a playground, or play in the yard. If it makes sense for your neighborhood and schedule, walk to and from activities and school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Do chores together.</strong>&nbsp;Perhaps it&rsquo;s not your child&rsquo;s first choice, but doing household chores is a very effective way to get exercise. Mopping, sweeping, taking out trash, dusting or vacuuming burns a surprising number of calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">Reduce screen time</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The less time your children spend watching TV, playing video games, or using computers or&nbsp;mobile devices, the more time they&rsquo;ll spend on active pastimes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Limit daily screen time.&nbsp;</strong>Studies show a link between screen time and obesity, so set limits on your child&rsquo;s TV-watching, gaming, and web surfing. Experts recommend no more than two hours per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Stop eating in front of the TV.&nbsp;</strong>Limit your child&rsquo;s calorie intake by limiting time spent eating in front of the tube. Tell your child that, starting now, your family does all their eating at the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Pick a different reward or punishment.</strong>&nbsp;Instead of rewarding your child with more time in front of the television or computer, promise something different, such as an outing or an activity of their choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n'),
(10, 'How to Sleep Better', 'uploads/weight loss3.jpg', 'Weight Loss', '2021-06-04 11:43:51', '<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How can I get a better night&rsquo;s sleep?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Sleeping well directly affects your mental and physical health. Fall short and it can take a serious toll on your daytime energy, productivity, emotional balance, and even your weight. Yet many of us regularly toss and turn at night, struggling to get the sleep we need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep may seem like an impossible goal when you&rsquo;re wide awake at 3 a.m., but you have much more control over the quality of your sleep than you probably realize. Just as the way you feel during your waking hours often hinges on how well you sleep at night, so the cure for sleep difficulties can often be found in your daily routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Unhealthy daytime habits and lifestyle choices can leave you tossing and turning at night and adversely affect your mood, brain and heart health, immune system, creativity, vitality, and weight. But by experimenting with the following tips, you can enjoy better sleep at night, boost your health, and improve how you think and feel during the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 1: Keep in sync with your body&rsquo;s natural sleep-wake cycle</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Getting in sync with your body&rsquo;s&nbsp;natural sleep-wake cycle, or circadian rhythm, is one of the most important strategies for sleeping better. If you keep a regular sleep-wake schedule, you&rsquo;ll feel much more refreshed and energized than if you sleep the same number of hours at different times, even if you only alter your sleep schedule by an hour or two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Try to go to sleep and get up at the same time every day.</strong>&nbsp;This helps set your body&rsquo;s internal clock and optimize the quality of your sleep. Choose a bed time when you normally feel tired, so that you don&rsquo;t toss and turn. If you&rsquo;re getting enough sleep, you should wake up naturally without an alarm. If you need an alarm clock, you may need an earlier bedtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Avoid sleeping in&mdash;even on weekends.</strong>&nbsp;The more your weekend/weekday sleep schedules differ, the worse the jetlag-like symptoms you&rsquo;ll experience. If you need to make up for a late night, opt for a daytime nap rather than sleeping in. This allows you to pay off your sleep debt without disturbing your natural sleep-wake rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Be smart about napping.</strong>&nbsp;While napping is a good way to make up for lost sleep, if you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at night, napping can make things worse. Limit naps to 15 to 20 minutes in the early afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 2: Control your exposure to light</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone controlled by light exposure that helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain secretes more melatonin when it&rsquo;s dark&mdash;making you sleepy&mdash;and less when it&rsquo;s light&mdash;making you more alert. However, many aspects of modern life can alter your body&rsquo;s production of melatonin and shift your circadian rhythm. Here&rsquo;s how to influence your exposure to light:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>During the day</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Expose yourself to bright sunlight in the morning.</strong>&nbsp;The closer to the time you get up, the better. Have your coffee outside, for example, or eat breakfast by a sunny window. The light on your face will help you wake up</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Spend more time outside during daylight.</strong>&nbsp;Take your work breaks outside in sunlight, exercise outside, or walk your dog during the day instead of at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Let as much natural light into your home or workspace as possible.</strong>&nbsp;Keep curtains and blinds open during the day, and try to move your desk closer to the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>At night</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Avoid bright screens within 1-2 hours of your bedtime.&nbsp;</strong>The blue light emitted by your phone, tablet, computer, or TV is especially disruptive. You can minimize the impact by using devices with smaller screens, turning the brightness down, or using light-altering software such as f.lux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Say no to late-night television.&nbsp;</strong>Not only does the light from a TV suppress melatonin, but many programs are stimulating rather than relaxing. Try listening to music or audio books instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>When it&rsquo;s time to sleep, make sure the room is dark.</strong>&nbsp;Use heavy curtains or shades to block light from windows, or try a sleep mask. Also consider covering up electronics that emit light.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 3: Exercise during the day</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">People who exercise regularly sleep better at night and feel less sleepy during the day. Regular exercise also improves the symptoms of insomnia&nbsp;and increases the amount of time you spend in the deep, restorative stages of sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>For better sleep, time your exercise right</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Exercise speeds up your metabolism, elevates body temperature, and stimulates hormones such as cortisol. This isn&rsquo;t a problem if you&rsquo;re exercising in the morning or afternoon, but too close to bed and it can interfere with sleep. Try to finish moderate to vigorous workouts at least three hours before bedtime. If you&rsquo;re still experiencing sleep difficulties, move your workouts even earlier. Relaxing, low-impact exercises such as yoga or gentle stretching in the evening can help promote sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 4: Be smart about what you eat and drink</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Your daytime eating habits play a role in how well you sleep, especially in the hours before bedtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Limit caffeine and nicotine.</strong>&nbsp;You might be surprised to know that caffeine can cause sleep problems up to ten to twelve hours after drinking it! Similarly,&nbsp;smoking&nbsp;is another stimulant that can disrupt your sleep, especially if you smoke close to bedtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Avoid big meals at night.</strong>&nbsp;Try to make dinnertime earlier in the evening, and avoid heavy, rich foods within two hours of bed. Spicy or acidic foods can cause stomach trouble and heartburn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cut back on sugary foods and refined carbs.</strong>&nbsp;Eating lots of&nbsp;sugar and refined carbs&nbsp;such as white bread, white rice, and pasta during the day can trigger wakefulness at night and pull you out of the deep, restorative stages of sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 5: Wind down and clear your head</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Do you often find yourself unable to get to sleep or regularly waking up night after night? Residual stress, worry, and anger from your day can make it very difficult to sleep well. Taking steps to manage your overall stress levels and&nbsp;learning how to curb the worry habit&nbsp;can make it easier to unwind at night. You can also try developing a relaxing bedtime ritual to help you prepare your mind for sleep, such as practicing a relaxation technique, taking a warm bath, or dimming the lights and listening to soft music or an audiobook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>A deep breathing exercise to help you sleep</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Breathing from your belly rather than your chest can activate the relaxation response and lower your heart rate, blood pressure, and stress levels to help you drift off to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Lay down in bed and close your eyes.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Put one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Breathe in through your nose. The hand on your stomach should rise. The hand on your chest should move very little.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Exhale through your mouth, pushing out as much air as you can while contracting your abdominal muscles. The hand on your stomach should move in as you exhale, but your other hand should move very little.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>A body scan exercise to help you sleep</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">By focusing your attention on different parts of your body, you can identify where you&rsquo;re holding any stress or tension, and release it.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Lie on your back, legs uncrossed, arms relaxed at your sides, eyes closed. Focus on your breathing for about two minutes until you start to feel relaxed.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Turn your focus to the toes of your right foot. Notice any tension while continuing to also focus on your breathing. Imagine each deep breath flowing to your toes. Remain focused on this area for at least three to five seconds.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">After completing the body scan, relax, noting how your body feels. You should feel so relaxed you can easily fall asleep.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 6: Improve your sleep environment</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A peaceful bedtime routine sends a powerful signal to your brain that it&rsquo;s time to wind down and let go of the day&rsquo;s stresses. Sometimes even small changes to your environment can make a big difference to your quality of sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Keep your room dark, cool, and quiet</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Keep noise down.</strong>&nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t avoid or eliminate noise from neighbors, traffic, or other people in your household, try masking it with a fan or sound machine. Earplugs may also help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Keep your room cool.</strong>&nbsp;Most people sleep best in a slightly cool room (around 65&deg; F or 18&deg; C) with adequate ventilation. A bedroom that is too hot or too cold can interfere with quality sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make sure your bed is comfortable.</strong>&nbsp;Your bed covers should leave you enough room to stretch and turn comfortably without becoming tangled. If you often wake up with a sore back or an aching neck, you may need to experiment with different levels of mattress firmness, foam toppers, and pillows that provide more or less support.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 7: Learn ways to get back to sleep</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It&rsquo;s normal to wake briefly during the night but if you&rsquo;re having&nbsp;trouble falling back asleep, these tips may help:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Stay out of your head.</strong>&nbsp;Hard as it may be, try not to stress over your inability to fall asleep again, because that stress only encourages your body to stay awake. To stay out of your head, focus on the feelings in your body or practice breathing exercises. Take a breath in, then breathe out slowly while saying or thinking the word, &ldquo;Ahhh.&rdquo; Take another breath and repeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make relaxation your goal, not sleep.</strong>&nbsp;If you find it hard to fall back asleep,&nbsp;try a relaxation technique&nbsp;such as visualization, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation, which can be done without even getting out of bed. Even though it&rsquo;s not a replacement for sleep, relaxation can still help rejuvenate your body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Do a quiet, non-stimulating activity.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve been awake for more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, non-stimulating activity, such as reading a book. Keep the lights dim and avoid screens so as not to cue your body that it&rsquo;s time to wake up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Postpone worrying and brainstorming.</strong>&nbsp;If you wake during the night feeling anxious about something, make a brief note of it on paper and&nbsp;postpone worrying&nbsp;about it until the next day when it will be easier to resolve. Similarly, if a great idea is keeping you awake, make a note of it on paper and fall back to sleep knowing you&rsquo;ll be much more productive after a good night&rsquo;s rest.</p>\r\n');

It draws people together in ways that trigger healthy physical and emotional changes in the body. Laughter strengthens your immune system, boosts mood, diminishes pain, and protects you from the damaging effects of stress. Nothing works faster or more dependably to bring your mind and body back into balance than a good laugh. Humor lightens your burdens, inspires hope, connects you to others, and keeps you grounded, focused, and alert. It also helps you release anger and forgive sooner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">With so much power to heal and renew, the ability to laugh easily and frequently is a tremendous resource for surmounting problems, enhancing your relationships, and supporting both physical and emotional health. Best of all, this priceless medicine is fun, free, and easy to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As children, we used to laugh hundreds of times a day, but as adults, life tends to be more serious and laughter more infrequent. But by seeking out more opportunities for humor and laughter, you can improve your emotional health, strengthen your relationships, find greater happiness&mdash;and even add years to your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Laughter is good for your health</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laughter relaxes the whole body.</strong>&nbsp;A good, hearty laugh relieves physical tension and stress, leaving your muscles relaxed for up to 45 minutes after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laughter boosts the immune system.</strong>&nbsp;Laughter decreases stress hormones and increases immune cells and infection-fighting antibodies, thus improving your resistance to disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laughter protects the heart.&nbsp;</strong>Laughter improves the function of blood vessels and increases blood flow, which can help protect you against a heart attack and other cardiovascular problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laughter burns calories.</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so it&rsquo;s no replacement for going to the gym, but one study found that laughing for 10 to 15 minutes a day can burn approximately 40 calories&mdash;which could be enough to lose three or four pounds over the course of a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laughter lightens anger&rsquo;s heavy load</strong>. Nothing diffuses anger and conflict faster than a shared laugh. Looking at the funny side can put problems into perspective and enable you to move on from confrontations without holding onto bitterness or resentment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Laughter helps you stay mentally healthy</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Laughter makes you feel good. And this positive feeling remains with you even after the laughter subsides. Humor helps you keep a positive, optimistic outlook through difficult situations, disappointments, and loss. More than just a respite from sadness and pain, laughter gives you the courage and strength to find new sources of meaning and hope. Even in the most difficult of times, a laugh&ndash;or even simply a smile&ndash;can go a long way toward making you feel better. And laughter really is contagious&mdash;just hearing laughter primes your brain and readies you to smile and join in the fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">The link between laughter and mental health</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laughter helps you relax and recharge.</strong>&nbsp;It reduces stress and increases energy, enabling you to stay focused and accomplish more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laughter shifts perspective</strong>, allowing you to see situations in a more realistic, less threatening light. A humorous perspective creates psychological distance, which can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed and diffuse conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laughter draws you closer to others,&nbsp;</strong>which can have a profound effect on all aspects of your mental and emotional health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Laughter brings people together and strengthens relationships</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">There&rsquo;s a good reason why TV sitcoms use laugh tracks: laughter is contagious. You&rsquo;re many times more likely to laugh around other people than when you&rsquo;re alone. And the more laughter you bring into your own life, the happier you and those around you will feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Sharing humor is half the fun&mdash;in fact, most laughter doesn&rsquo;t come from hearing jokes, but rather simply from spending time with friends and family. And it&rsquo;s this social aspect that plays such an important role in the health benefits of laughter. You can&rsquo;t enjoy a laugh with other people unless you take the time to really engage with them. And if you share a laugh, you&rsquo;ll both feel happier, more positive, and more relaxed&mdash;even if you&rsquo;re unable to alter a stressful situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">How laughing together can strengthen relationships</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Shared laughter is one of the most effective tools for keeping relationships fresh and exciting. All emotional sharing builds strong and lasting relationship bonds, but sharing laughter also adds joy, vitality, and resilience. And humor is a powerful and effective way to heal resentments, disagreements, and hurts. Laughter unites people during difficult times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Humor and playful communication strengthen our relationships by triggering positive feelings and fostering emotional connection. When we laugh with one another, a positive bond is created. This bond acts as a strong buffer against stress, disagreements, and disappointment. Humor and laughter in relationships allows you to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Be more spontaneous.</strong>&nbsp;Humor gets you out of your head and away from your troubles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Let go of defensiveness.</strong>&nbsp;Laughter helps you forget resentments, judgments, criticisms, and doubts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Express your true feelings.</strong>&nbsp;Deeply felt emotions are allowed to rise to the surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How to bring more laughter into your life</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Laughter is your birthright, a natural part of life that is innate and inborn. Infants begin smiling during the first weeks of life and laugh out loud within months of being born. Even if you did not grow up in a household where laughter was a common sound, you can learn to laugh at any stage of life. Begin by setting aside special times to seek out humor and laughter, as you might with exercising, and build from there. Eventually, you&rsquo;ll want to incorporate humor and laughter into the fabric of your life, finding it naturally in everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Here are some ways to start:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Smile.</strong>&nbsp;Smiling is the beginning of laughter, and like laughter, it&rsquo;s contagious. When you look at someone or see something even mildly pleasing, practice smiling. Instead of looking down at your phone, look up and smile at people you pass in the street, the person serving you a morning coffee, or the co-workers you share an elevator with. Notice the effect on others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Count your blessings.</strong>&nbsp;Literally make a list. The simple act of considering the positive aspects of your life will distance you from negative thoughts that block humor and laughter. When you&rsquo;re in a state of sadness, you have further to travel to reach humor and laughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Spend time with fun, playful people.</strong>&nbsp;These are people who laugh easily&ndash;both at themselves and at life&rsquo;s absurdities&ndash;and who routinely find the humor in everyday events. Their playful point of view and laughter are contagious. Even if you don&rsquo;t consider yourself a lighthearted, humorous person, you can still seek out people who like to laugh and make others laugh. Every comedian appreciates an audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Simulated laughter</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">So, what if you really can&rsquo;t &ldquo;find the funny?&rdquo; Believe it or not, it&rsquo;s possible to laugh without experiencing a funny event&mdash;and simulated laughter can be just as beneficial as the real thing.&nbsp;Hearing others laugh, even for no apparent reason, can often trigger genuine laughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">To add simulated laughter into your own life, search for laugh yoga or laugh therapy groups. Or you can start simply by laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, even if you don&rsquo;t find them funny. Both you and the other person will feel good, it will draw you closer together, and who knows, it may even lead to some spontaneous laughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tips for developing your sense of humor</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">An essential ingredient for developing your sense of humor is to learn not to take yourself too seriously and laugh at your own mistakes and foibles. As much as we&rsquo;d like to believe otherwise, we all do foolish things from time to time. Instead of feeling embarrassed or defensive, embrace your imperfections. While some events in life are clearly sad and not opportunities for laughter, most don&rsquo;t carry an overwhelming sense of either sadness&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;delight. They fall into the gray zone of ordinary life&mdash;giving you the choice to laugh or not. So, choose to laugh whenever you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">How to develop your sense of humor</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Laugh at yourself.</strong>&nbsp;Share your embarrassing moments. The best way to take yourself less seriously is to talk about times when you took yourself&nbsp;<em>too&nbsp;</em>seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Surround yourself with reminders to lighten up.</strong>&nbsp;Keep a toy on your desk or in your car. Put up a funny poster in your office. Choose a computer screensaver that makes you laugh. Frame photos of you and your family or friends having fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Remember funny things that happen.</strong>&nbsp;If something amusing happens or you hear a joke or funny story you really like, write it down or tell it to someone to help you remember it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Find your inner child.&nbsp;</strong>Pay attention to children and try to emulate them&mdash;after all, they are the experts on playing, taking life lightly, and laughing at ordinary things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Deal with stress.</strong>&nbsp;Stress can be a major impediment to humor and laughter, so it&rsquo;s important to keep your stress levels in check. One great technique to relieve&nbsp;stress in the moment&nbsp;is to draw upon a favorite memory that always makes you smile&mdash;something your kids did, for example, or something funny a friend told you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Don&rsquo;t go a day without laughing.&nbsp;</strong>Think of it like exercise or breakfast and make a conscious effort to find something each day that makes you laugh. Set aside 10 to 15 minutes and do something that amuses you. The more you get used to laughing each day, the less effort you&rsquo;ll have to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Using humor to overcome challenges and enhance your life</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The ability to laugh, play, and have fun not only makes life more enjoyable but also helps you solve problems, connect with others, and think more creatively. People who incorporate humor and play into their daily lives find that it renews them and all of their relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Life brings challenges that can either get the best of you or become playthings for your imagination. When you &ldquo;become the problem&rdquo; and take yourself too seriously, it can be hard to think outside the box and find new solutions. But when you play with the problem, you can often transform it into an opportunity for creative learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Playing with problems seems to come naturally to children. When they are confused or afraid, they make their problems into a game, giving them a sense of control and an opportunity to experiment with new solutions. Interacting with others in playful ways helps you retain this creative ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Here are two examples of people who took everyday problems and turned them around through laughter and play:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As laughter, humor, and play become integrated into your life, your creativity will flourish and new opportunities for laughing with friends, coworkers, acquaintances, and loved ones will occur to you daily. Laughter takes you to a higher place where you can view the world from a more relaxed, positive, and joyful perspective.</p>\r\n'),

Even in these tough times, you&nbsp; can find joy in your daily life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Now more than ever, finding joy in your day-to-day experiences can improve your quality of life and enhance and protect your mental health. As many of us are mired in intense and heavy information from the news and social media, financial instability, and political and civil unrest, it&rsquo;s become more and more difficult to find peace&mdash;both internally and externally. Furthermore, for many adults who are working from home while taking on new roles and responsibilities for their children&rsquo;s academic needs, a newfound stress in the home is ever present. How can we, both individually and as a collective, &ldquo;spark joy&rdquo; to lift our own and each other&rsquo;s spirits to get through difficult times?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tips for finding joy in your life</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Here are some ideas to give you a pick me up:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Listen to your favorite music</strong>. It can help you recall positive memories, providing an escape from the day-to-day difficulties you may be facing. Recalling these memories by listening to music is an easy and passive way to boost your mood while you&rsquo;re working, cleaning, or just hanging out at home. Research has shown that listening to your favorite jams can reduce anxiety,&nbsp;lower blood pressure,&nbsp;improve sleep quality, and enhance mood, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Develop a daily gratitude practice</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a big ordeal; just think of one to three simple statements a day such as, &ldquo;I am grateful I have a roof over my head,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am grateful for the sun that rises each morning that I feel on my skin,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am grateful for the delicious strawberries I had today.&rdquo; At the end of each day, write in a journal or say aloud the things you were grateful for, as simple as they may be. By doing this, even during the most difficult or distressing times, your gratitude practice will help bring your circumstances into perspective, indirectly create joy, and keep you grounded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Spend time in a vision practice</strong>. Close your eyes and focus on your very favorite place, person, mantra, prayer, or even vacation. Breathe into the moment and envision yourself in this space or situation. Consider the colors, tastes, textures, and conversations. Try to spend a dedicated five minutes soaking in the moment, slowing down your breathing and relaxing your body. Some people find that this practice is enhanced either by laying down with bolsters under the legs and a weighted blanket on top of the body or by sitting in a chair with a cushion behind the back and under the feet.&nbsp;Meditating regularly&nbsp;in this way can help remind you that aspects of whatever difficult situation you&rsquo;re dealing with&mdash;such as isolation, sadness, or desperation&mdash;are temporary. You will once again have more positive experiences, and these short meditations may even help you create new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Find the &ldquo;awe&rdquo; moment every day</strong>. &ldquo;Awe&rdquo; is the concept of experiencing wonder and amazement. Awe frequently conjures up the idea of something &ldquo;big&rdquo; like snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef or seeing the Eiffel Tower in Paris. However, researchers are finding that if we take the time to notice small, pleasurable moments every day, we can reap the same benefits. Awe moments can be found in seeing the sun rise, for example, or watching ants march. We can also experience &ldquo;awe&rdquo; by reading beautiful poetry or hiking on a new path and seeing interesting rocks or flowers. Take the time to notice things around you that you may have taken for granted. By relishing them and their place in the world (and yours), you can derive more meaning from your life, feel more connected to the world at large, and experience more joy in the day to day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tips for helping others experience joy</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The following ideas can help others experience joy. Since helping others is one of the best ways to feel happier and healthier yourself, when they feel joy, you will, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Send letters, poems, or drawings</strong>&nbsp;to first responders, essential workers, or elderly people on their own, for example. By engaging in this activity, you are bringing a sense of comfort and joy to others and giving yourself a feeling of fulfillment for having passed on some happiness to others. Additionally, it can help shift your attention away from your own day-to-day struggles and the heaviness you may be feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Start collecting spare change</strong>&nbsp;or a small amount of money every day, with the intention of donating it to a charity of your choice. At the end of a designated period of time (one to three months), write a letter to the charity letting them know what you did, why, and the meaning behind the donation. Saving the money and seeing the fruits of your labor will spark joy that you were able to meet a goal. Additionally, by writing a letter you&rsquo;ll be able to express your intentions of goodwill to another. Oftentimes, when we voice our positivity instead of keeping it inside, we can further feel joy throughout our soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Run an errand for a friend or order food for them</strong>. Helping others with even something small can be a big stress reducer right now. They will be so thankful. And from their gratitude, you&rsquo;ll experience a sense of joy&mdash;as will they.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align:justify">Let your joy be in your journey</h4>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As you can see, experiencing joy, even in light of all the difficulties we are facing at this time both personally and collectively, can be achieved by some easy modifications to our day-to-day activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n'),

Somewhere between childhood and adulthood, we stopped playing. When we carve out some leisure time, we&rsquo;re more likely to zone out in front of the TV or computer than engage in fun, rejuvenating play like we did as children. But play is not just essential for kids; it can be an important source of relaxation and stimulation for adults as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Playing with your romantic partner, friends, co-workers, pets, and children is a sure (and fun) way to fuel your imagination, creativity, problem-solving abilities, and emotional well-being. Adult play is a time to forget about work and commitments, and to be social in an unstructured, creative way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">The benefits of play</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Play can add joy to life, relieve stress, supercharge learning, and connect you to others and the world around you. Play can also make work more productive and pleasurable. You can play on your own, but for greater benefits, play should involve at least one other person.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Play helps:</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Relieve stress.&nbsp;</strong>Play is fun and can trigger the release of endorphins, the body&rsquo;s natural feel-good chemicals. Endorphins promote an overall sense of well-being and can even temporarily relieve pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Improve brain function.&nbsp;</strong>Playing chess, completing puzzles, or pursuing other fun activities that challenge the brain can help prevent memory problems and improve brain function. The social interaction of playing with family and friends can also help ward off stress and depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Improve relationships and your connection to others.&nbsp;</strong>Sharing laughter and fun can foster empathy, compassion, trust, and intimacy with others. Play doesn&rsquo;t have to include a specific activity; it can also be a state of mind. Developing a playful nature can help you loosen up in stressful situations, break the ice with strangers, make new friends, and form new business relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Keep you feeling young and energetic.&nbsp;</strong>In the words of George Bernard Shaw, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.&rdquo; Play can boost your energy and vitality and even improve your resistance to disease, helping you function at your best.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Play and relationships</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Play is one of the most effective tools for keeping relationships fresh and exciting. Playing together brings joy, vitality, and resilience to relationships. Play can also heal resentments, disagreements, and hurts. Through regular play, we learn to trust one another and feel safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Trust enables us to work together, open ourselves to intimacy, and try new things. By making a conscious effort to incorporate more humor and play into your daily interactions, you can improve the quality of your love relationships&mdash;as well as your connections with co-workers, family members, and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Play helps develop and improve social skills.</strong>&nbsp;Social skills are learned as part of the give and take of play. During childhood play, kids learn about verbal communication, body language, boundaries, cooperation, and teamwork. As adults, you continue to refine these skills through play and playful communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Play teaches cooperation with others.</strong>&nbsp;Play is a powerful catalyst for positive socialization. Through play, children learn how to &ldquo;play nicely&rdquo; with others&mdash;to work together, follow mutually agreed upon rules, and socialize in groups. As adults, you can continue to use play to break down barriers and improve your relationships with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Play can heal emotional wounds.</strong>&nbsp;As adults, when you play together, you are engaging in exactly the same patterns of behavior that positively shape the brains of children. These same playful behaviors that predict emotional health in children can also lead to positive changes in adults. If an emotionally insecure individual plays with a secure partner, for example, it can help replace negative beliefs and behaviors with positive assumptions and actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Play at work</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Many dot-com companies have long recognized the link between productivity and a fun work environment. Some encourage play and creativity by offering art or yoga classes, throwing regular parties, providing games such as Foosball or ping pong, or encouraging recess-like breaks during the workday for employees to play and let off steam. These companies know that more play at work results in more productivity, higher job satisfaction, greater workplace morale, and a decrease in employees skipping work and staff turnover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;re fortunate enough to work for such a company, embrace the culture; if your company lacks the play ethic, you can still inject your own sense of play into breaks and lunch hours. Keep a camera or sketch pad on hand and take creative breaks when you can. Joke with coworkers during coffee breaks, relieve stress at lunch by shooting hoops, playing cards, or completing word puzzles together. It can strengthen the bond you have with your coworkers as well as improve your job performance. For people with mundane jobs, maintaining a sense of play can make a real difference to the work day by helping to relieve boredom.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Using play to boost productivity and innovation</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Success at work doesn&rsquo;t depend on the amount of time you work; it depends upon the quality of your work. And the quality of your work is highly dependent on your well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Taking the time to replenish yourself through play is one of the best ways you can help your career. When the project you&rsquo;re working on hits a serious glitch, take some time out to play and have a few laughs. Taking a pause for play does a lot more than take your mind off the problem. When you play, you engage the creative side of your brain and silence your &ldquo;inner editor,&rdquo; that psychological barrier that censors your thoughts and ideas. This can often help you see the problem in a new light and think up fresh, creative solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Playing at work:</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">refreshes your mind and body</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">encourages teamwork</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">increases energy and prevents burnout</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">triggers creativity and innovation</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">helps you see problems in new ways</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Playing with your children</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Rolling on the floor with your baby or getting down on your knees to play with a young child is vitally important&mdash;both to your child&rsquo;s development and to your own health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Play is essential for developing social, emotional, cognitive, and physical skills in children. In fact, far from being a waste of time or just a fun distraction, play is a time when your child is often learning the most. Whether it&rsquo;s an infant playing &ldquo;peek-a-boo,&rdquo; a toddler playing make-believe, or an older child playing a board game, play develops social skills, stimulates a child&rsquo;s imagination and makes kids better adjusted, smarter, and less stressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As well as aiding your child&rsquo;s development, play can also bring you closer together and strengthen the parent-child bond that will last a lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">How to play with your child</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While children need time to play alone and with other children, playing with their parents is also important. Here are some helpful tips to encourage play:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Establish regular play times.</strong>&nbsp;It may be for twenty minutes before dinner every night or every Saturday morning, for example. Remember, this time spent playing together is benefiting both of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Give your child your undivided attention.</strong>&nbsp;Turn off the TV and your cell phone and make time to play with your child without distraction. Having your undivided attention makes your child feel special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Get down to your child&rsquo;s level.</strong>&nbsp;That may mean getting down on your knees or sitting on the floor. Match your child&rsquo;s intensity during play&mdash;if your child is loud and energetic, be loud and energetic, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Embrace repetition.</strong>&nbsp;It may be boring to you, but it&rsquo;s not to your child. Children learn through repetition. Let your child play the same game over and over. Your child will move on when he or she is ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Let your children take the lead.&nbsp;</strong>Become part of their game rather than trying to dictate the play. In pretend play, let your child call the shots, make the rules, and determine the pace of play. Ask questions and follow along&mdash;you&rsquo;ll likely get drawn into imaginative new worlds that are fun for you, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make play age-appropriate and consider safety.</strong>&nbsp;If a game is too hard or too easy, it loses its sense of pleasure and fun. Help your child find age-appropriate activities and understand any safety rules for play. Nothing ruins a fun game faster than a child getting hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How to play more</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Incorporating more fun and play into your daily life can improve the quality of your relationships, as well as your mood and outlook. Even in the most difficult of times, taking time away from your troubles to play or laugh can go a long way toward making you feel better. It&rsquo;s true what they say:&nbsp;laughter really is the best<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/laughter-is-the-best-medicine.htm"> </a>medicine. Laughter makes you feel good. And the positive feeling that comes from laughter and having fun remains with you even after the giggles subside. Play and laughter help you retain a positive, optimistic outlook through difficult situations, disappointments, and loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Develop your playful side</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It&rsquo;s never too late to develop your playful, humorous side. If you find yourself limiting your playfulness, it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;re self-conscious and concerned about how you&rsquo;ll look and sound to others when attempting to be lighthearted. Fearing rejection, embarrassment or ridicule when trying to be playful is understandable. Adults often worry that being playful will get them labeled as childish. But what is so wrong with that? Children are incredibly creative, inventive and are constantly learning. Wouldn&rsquo;t you want to be childish if that is the definition? Remember that as a child, you were naturally playful; you didn&rsquo;t worry about the reactions of other people. You can reclaim your inner child by setting aside&nbsp;<em>regular, quality playtime</em>. The more you play, joke, and laugh&mdash;the easier it becomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Try to clear your schedule for an afternoon or evening, for example, and then turn off your phone, TV, computer, and other devices. Give yourself permission to do whatever you want for the time you&rsquo;ve allotted. Be spontaneous, set aside your inhibitions and try something fun, something you haven&rsquo;t done since you were a kid, perhaps. And enjoy the change of pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Creating opportunities to play</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Host a regular game</strong>&nbsp;night with friends or family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Arrange nights out with work colleagues:</strong>&nbsp;bowling, playing pool, miniature golf, or singing karaoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Schedule time in a park</strong>&nbsp;or at the beach to throw a Frisbee or fly a kite with friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Surround yourself with playful people.</strong>&nbsp;They&rsquo;ll help loosen you up and are more likely to support your efforts to play and have fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Joke with strangers</strong>&nbsp;at a bus stop or in a checkout line. It&rsquo;ll make the time pass quicker and you may even spark up new friendships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Play with children.</strong>&nbsp;Goofing around with kids helps you experience the joy of play from their perspective. If you don&rsquo;t have young children, arrange a play date with your grandkids, nephews, nieces, or other young relatives.</p>\r\n');

You already know there are many great reasons to exercise&mdash;from improving energy, mood, sleep, and health to reducing anxiety, stress, and depression. But if knowing how and why to exercise was enough, we&rsquo;d all be in shape. Making exercise a habit takes more&mdash;you need the right mindset and a smart approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While practical concerns like a busy schedule or poor health can make exercise more challenging, for most of us. Maybe it&rsquo;s a lack of self-confidence that keeps you from taking positive steps,&nbsp;or you get easily discouraged and give up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Whatever your age or fitness level&mdash;even if you&rsquo;ve never exercised a day in your life &mdash;there are steps you can take to make exercise less&nbsp;painful and more fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Be kind to yourself. </strong>Self-compassion increases the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll succeed in any given endeavor. So, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up about your body, your current fitness level, or your supposed lack of willpower. All that will demotivate you. Instead, look at your past mistakes and unhealthy choices as opportunities to learn and grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Check your expectations</strong>. You didn&rsquo;t get out of shape overnight, and you&rsquo;re not going to instantly transform your body either. Expecting too much, too soon only leads to frustration. Try not to be discouraged by what you can&rsquo;t accomplish or how far you have to go to reach your fitness goals. Instead of obsessing over results, focus on consistency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Excuses for not exercising</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Making excuses for not exercising? Whether it&rsquo;s lack of time or energy, or fear of the gym, there are solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Excuse 1: &ldquo;I hate exercising.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;Many of us feel the same. If sweating in a gym or pounding a treadmill isn&rsquo;t your idea of a great time, try to find an activity that you do enjoy&mdash;such as dancing&mdash;or pair physical activity with something more enjoyable.&nbsp;Take a walk&nbsp;at lunchtime through a scenic park, for example, walk laps of an air-conditioned mall while window shopping, walk,&nbsp;or bike with a friend, or listen to your favorite music while you move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Excuse 2: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too busy.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;Even the busiest of us can find free time in our day for activities that are important. It&rsquo;s your decision to make exercise a priority. And don&rsquo;t think you need a full hour for a good workout. Short 5 -10 minutes of activity can prove very effective. If you&rsquo;re too busy during the week, get up and get moving during the weekend when you have more time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Excuse 3: &ldquo;Exercise is too difficult and painful.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;No pain, no gain&rdquo; is an outdated way of thinking about exercise. Exercise shouldn&rsquo;t hurt. And you don&rsquo;t have to push yourself until you&rsquo;re soaked in sweat or every muscle aches to get results. You can build your strength and fitness by walking, swimming, gardening, or cleaning the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Getting started safely</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;ve never exercised before, or it&rsquo;s been a significant amount of time since you&rsquo;ve attempted any strenuous physical activity, keep the following health precautions in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Health issues? Get medical clearance first.</strong>&nbsp;If you have health concerns such as&nbsp;limited mobility, heart disease, asthma, diabetes, or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor before you start to exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Warm up.</strong>&nbsp;Warm up with dynamic stretches&mdash;active movements that warm and flex the muscles you&rsquo;ll be using, such as leg kicks, walking lunges, or arm swings&mdash;and by doing a slower, easier version of the upcoming exercise. For example, if you&rsquo;re going to run, warm up by walking. Or if you&rsquo;re lifting weights, begin with a few light reps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Drink plenty of water.</strong>&nbsp;Your body performs best when it&rsquo;s properly hydrated. Failing to drink enough water when you are exerting yourself over a prolonged period of time, especially in hot conditions, can be dangerous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Listen to your body.</strong>&nbsp;If you feel pain or discomfort while working out, stop! If you feel better after a brief rest, you can slowly and gently resume your workout. But don&rsquo;t try to power through pain. That&rsquo;s a surefire recipe for injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How to make exercise a habit that sticks</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It&rsquo;s not that you simply don&rsquo;t have what it takes. Science shows us that there&rsquo;s a right way to build habits that last. Follow these steps to make exercise one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Start small and build momentum</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A goal of exercising for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week may sound good. But how likely are you to follow through? The more ambitious your goal, the more likely you are to fail, feel bad about it, and give up. It&rsquo;s better to start with easy exercise goals you know you can achieve. As you meet them, you&rsquo;ll build self-confidence and momentum. Then you can move on to more challenging goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Reward yourself</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">People who exercise regularly tend to do so because of the rewards it brings to their lives, such as more energy, better sleep, and a greater sense of well-being. When you&rsquo;re starting an exercise program, it&rsquo;s important to give yourself immediate rewards when you successfully complete a workout or reach a new fitness goal. Choose something you look forward to, but don&rsquo;t allow yourself to do until after exercise. It can be something as simple as having a hot bath or a favorite cup of coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Choose activities that make you feel happy and confident</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If your workout is unpleasant or makes you feel clumsy or inept, you&rsquo;re unlikely to stick with it. Don&rsquo;t choose activities like running or lifting weights at the gym just because you think that&rsquo;s what you should do. Instead, pick activities that fit your lifestyle, abilities, and taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</h4>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Set yourself up for success&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Schedule it</strong>. You don&rsquo;t attend meetings and appointments spontaneously, you schedule them. If you&rsquo;re having trouble fitting exercise into your schedule, consider it an important appointment with yourself and mark it on your daily agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Remove obstacles</strong>. Plan ahead for anything that might get in the way of exercising. Do you tend to run out of time in the morning? Get your workout clothes out the night before so you&rsquo;re ready to go as soon as you get up. Do you skip your evening workout if you go home first? Keep a gym bag in the car, so you can head out straight from work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Hold yourself accountable.&nbsp;</strong>Commit to another person. If you&rsquo;ve got a workout partner waiting, you&rsquo;re less likely to skip out. Or ask a friend or family member to check in on your progress. Announcing your goals to your social group (either online or in person) can also help keep you on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tips for making exercise more enjoyable</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As previously noted, you are much more likely to stick with an exercise program that&rsquo;s fun and rewarding. No amount of willpower is going to keep you going long-term with a workout you hate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Think outside the gym</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Does the thought of going to the gym fill you with dread? If you find the gym inconvenient, expensive, or simply boring, that&rsquo;s okay. There are many exercise alternatives to weight rooms and cardio equipment. You may enjoy running outdoors, where you can enjoy alone time and nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Just about everyone can find a physical activity they enjoy. But you may need to think beyond the standard running, swimming, and biking options. Here are a few activities you may find fun:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">ballroom dancing</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hiking</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">gymnastics</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">martial arts</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">rock climbing</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Make it a game</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Activity-based video games such as those from Wii and Kinect can be a fun way to start moving. So-called &ldquo;exergames&rdquo; that are played standing up and moving around&mdash;simulating dancing, skateboarding, soccer, bowling, or tennis, for example&mdash;can burn at least as many calories as walking on a treadmill; some substantially more. Once you build up your confidence, try getting away from the TV screen and playing the real thing outside. Or use a smartphone app to keep your workouts fun and interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Make it social</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Exercise can be a fun time to socialize with friends and working out with others can help keep you motivated. For those who enjoy company but dislike competition, a running club, water aerobics, or dance class may be the perfect thing. Others may find that a little healthy competition keeps the workout fun and exciting. You might seek out tennis partners, join an adult soccer league, find a regular pickup basketball game, or join a volleyball team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Getting&nbsp;the&nbsp;whole family involved</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you have a family, there are many ways to exercise together. What&rsquo;s more, kids learn by example, and if you exercise as a family you are setting a great example for their future. Family activities might include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Family walks in the evening if weather permits. Infants or young children can ride in a stroller.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Seasonal activities, like skiing or ice skating in the winter and hiking, swimming, or cycling in the summer can both make fun family memories and provide healthy exercise.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Easy ways to &ldquo;sneak&rdquo; more movement into your daily life</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;re not the kind of person who embraces a structured exercise program, try to think about physical activity as a lifestyle choice rather than a task to check off your to-do list. Look at your daily routine and consider ways to sneak in activity here and there. Even very small activities can add up over the course of a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make chores count.</strong>&nbsp;House and yard work can be quite a workout, especially when done at a brisk pace. Scrub, vacuum, sweep, dust, mow, and weed&mdash;it all counts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Look for ways to add extra steps.&nbsp;</strong>Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator. Park farther from a building entrance, rather than right out front. Get off your train or bus one stop early. The extra walking adds up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Move at work.&nbsp;</strong>Get up to talk to co-workers, rather than phoning or sending an email. Take a walk during your coffee and lunch breaks. Use the bathroom on another floor. Walk while you&rsquo;re talking on the phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How to stay motivated to exercise</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">No matter how much you enjoy an exercise routine, you may find that you eventually lose interest in it. That&rsquo;s the time to shake things up and try something new or alter the way you pursue the exercises that have worked so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Pair your workout with a treat.</strong>&nbsp;For example, you can listen to an audiobook or watch your favorite TV show while on the treadmill or stationary bike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Log your activity.</strong>&nbsp;Keep a record of your workouts and fitness progress. Writing things down or tracking them on an app increases commitment and holds you accountable to your routine. Later on, it will also be encouraging to look back at where you began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Harness the power of the community.</strong>&nbsp;Having others rooting for us and supporting us through exercise ups and downs helps to keep motivation strong. There are numerous online fitness communities you can join. You can also try working out with friends either in person or remotely using fitness apps that let you track and compare your progress with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Get inspired.</strong>&nbsp;Read a health and fitness magazine or visit an exercise website and get inspired with photos of people being active. Sometimes reading about and looking at images of people who are healthy and fit can motivate you to move your body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n'),

Walking could just be the way. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You already know how to do it.</strong>&nbsp;Just put one foot in front of the other. There&rsquo;s no learning curve like you would have if you took up a new activity, such as Zumba or tennis.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can do it anywhere.</strong>&nbsp;Step out your front door. Take a walk from where you work. You can walk around areas that you frequent, such as the grocery store, a shopping center, a place of worship, or the homes of friends and family.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You don&rsquo;t need any special equipment.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re walking for exercise, it&rsquo;s best to have a comfortable pair of shoes, preferably sneakers. But that&rsquo;s it! While there are some items of clothing and gear that can make walking more enjoyable, they are not essential.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>It&rsquo;s gentle on your knees&mdash;and the rest of your body.</strong>&nbsp;Unlike running, you keep one foot on the ground at all times when you&rsquo;re walking, making it a low-impact, joint-friendly type of exercise.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Walking is not only healthy and easy, but it&rsquo;s also fun</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">To some people, exercise feels like drudgery. With walking, however, you can pamper yourself in multiple ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can do it with others.</strong>&nbsp;Invite family, friends, or co-workers to join you for a walk. It&rsquo;s a great way to catch up or get to know someone better. And if you need to have a tough conversation with someone, try doing it while walking. Striding side by side can make discussions easier because you&rsquo;re more relaxed than when you&rsquo;re sitting face to face.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can get &ldquo;me&rdquo; time.</strong>&nbsp;Heading out by yourself can be a good way to escape the demands and expectations that occupy much of your time. As you stroll, you can clear your head, relax, and reflect. It can be valuable, quiet &ldquo;me&rdquo; time, allowing you to return refreshed.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can enjoy a dose of nature.</strong>&nbsp;Studies show that spending time in parks or near water can boost your mood. Walking is a great way to get out in nature.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can gain a new perspective.</strong>&nbsp;The world is different when you view it at 3 mph instead of 25 or 30 mph. You might discover an interesting shop, observe intricate architecture, or meet a friendly person.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can be more creative.</strong>&nbsp;Stanford University researchers found that people generated twice as many creative responses to problems when walking compared with sitting. And the creative juices continued to flow even when they sat down after their walk&mdash;another good reason to take a walking break during the workday.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Starting a walking program</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You&rsquo;ve been walking for years. If you have kids, you helped them learn to do it. So what in the world don&rsquo;t you know about walking? When you start walking for health, you may find there are actually a lot of points you&rsquo;ve never considered. Where do you walk, if your neighborhood doesn&rsquo;t have sidewalks?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Where to walk</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The beauty of walking is that you can do it practically anywhere. Where you walk is a matter of personal preference and safety. Some people enjoy the fresh air and scenery of outdoor walking, while others prefer the climate control and safety of walking indoors on a treadmill or at a mall. Whatever your preference, don&rsquo;t get stuck in the rut of always walking in the same location. No matter what your preference is, the most important thing is that you walk consistently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Outdoor options:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Neighborhood.</strong>&nbsp;Just step out your front door. You can&rsquo;t beat that for convenience. If it&rsquo;s not safe to walk near your home, consider walking in a neighborhood near your office or other locations that you frequent, like the grocery store or a family member&rsquo;s or friend&rsquo;s home.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Downtown.</strong>&nbsp;If your community or a nearby one has a downtown area, explore it on foot. You can window-shop along the way or admire the architecture. Downtowns are a good place to walk because they usually have sidewalks and crosswalks to help keep you safe.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Open-air shopping complexes.</strong>&nbsp;Similar to downtowns, these areas usually offer sidewalks and crosswalks, and they are usually cleared if there&rsquo;s snow or ice.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Parks and trails.</strong>&nbsp;Studies show that people walk more if they live near parks or trails. If a leisurely walk is what you&rsquo;re after, stick to level or gently rolling paths and avoid rocky terrain. Want to go for a speed walk? Paved or packed dirt paths are best. Trails with a steeper incline let you get a more vigorous trek without having to pick up your pace.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tracks.</strong>&nbsp;You can usually find these at schools, but some parks offer them as well.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Indoor options:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Malls.</strong>&nbsp;While you could walk around a mall anytime it&rsquo;s open, arriving early, before the crowds, is the best way to get a good cardio workout. If your mall has multiple floors, take advantage of the stairs.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Your living room&mdash;or any other room in your house.</strong>&nbsp;Simply stepping in place will burn calories&mdash;about 250 in an hour if you weigh 180 pounds. Try doing it while you watch your favorite TV show.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A gym or fitness center.</strong>&nbsp;If a personal treadmill isn&rsquo;t an option, you might want to consider joining a fitness center to have access to a treadmill, especially during seasons when walking outdoors may be difficult in your area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Types of&nbsp;&nbsp;walking</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">All walks are good for you. But there&rsquo;s more than one way to walk. Depending upon your goals, you may need to try a different type of walking. Here is an overview of different styles of walking and how each may benefit you.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Everyday walking.</strong>&nbsp;This is ambling around your house or place of work, walking to and from your car, strolling around shopping, or any other incidental activities that require a little bit of walking.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leisure walking.</strong>&nbsp;Strolling while chatting with a friend or walking the dog are examples of leisure walking. When you&rsquo;re walking leisurely or strolling, you&rsquo;re relaxed and moving easily. Your effort is light enough that you&rsquo;d be able to sing while you walked.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fitness walking.&nbsp;</strong>This type of walking is faster and more purposeful. Fitness walking can be done at a variety of levels, but basically it&rsquo;s a brisk pace. You should be breathing harder and your heart beating faster, but you should still be able to speak in complete sentences.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interval walking.</strong>&nbsp;For this type of walk, you alternate fast walking for short periods of time with equal or longer intervals of slower or moderate-paced walking to recover.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hiking.</strong>&nbsp;This is simply walking in the woods or some other natural setting. As with other types of walking, there are different levels of difficulty&mdash;from level, well-groomed trails to steep, rocky routes marked with trail blazes that require more attention to ensure you stay on the right path.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Nordic walking</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For this workout, you&rsquo;ll need a pair of Nordic (or fitness) walking poles Follow the instructions that came with your poles to ensure that you have the proper height and that you are using them in the correct way. Use the rubber tip if you are walking on asphalt or concrete. The spike tip is for walking on grass or dirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Start by swinging your arms without gripping the poles as you walk. The poles will dangle from the straps on your wrists and drag along the ground. Your arms should be extended and swing naturally, coming up no higher than about waist height. As you become comfortable with this motion, lightly grasp the pole as it comes forward and press the pole tip down and back into the ground. As you extend your arm behind you, open your hand. The pole should always be pointing diagonally behind you. Don&rsquo;t plant the pole out in front of you, as you would if you were using poles during hiking to take pressure off your joints. You should always maintain a relaxed grip and use the straps to press down on the back swing. The more pressure, the more upper-body muscles you will activate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Mindful walking</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The goal of this type of walking is to reduce stress and be more present in the moment. By taking a &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; walk, you get the benefits of meditation without having to sit still. There are a variety of ways to do it, from simply walking with more awareness to following a more structured routine. Walking with awareness means paying more attention to your surroundings, your thoughts, or the physical sensations, such as the wind blowing against your face or your foot landing on the ground and rolling from your heel to your toes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Unlike many other types of walking, the goal is not to go faster or get a better workout. The focus is on calming down, reducing stress, and relaxing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Attending to the following points will help you taking a mindful walk:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Start by bringing your attention to the sensations in your body.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Breathe in smoothly through your nose, taking deep breaths. Feel your lungs expand from top to bottom rather than just at the top.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Engage your senses fully. Notice each sight, touch, and sound so that you savor every sensation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Try two variations while taking a mindful walk:</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">An easy, leisurely stroll, breathing normally while paying attention to your inhalations and exhalations</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">A moderate, purposeful walk. Match your breath to your steps for 4&ndash;8 steps while inhaling smoothly. Exhale smoothly for the same 4&ndash;8 steps.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n'),

You may only have limited access to fitness facilities or find it difficult to adjust to a new routine. If you&rsquo;re used to attending a fitness class with a motivating instructor, you might also be disappointed in the intensity of workouts on your own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Maintaining an exercise routine at home or in a hotel room can seem more like a &lsquo;should&rsquo; than a &lsquo;want to&rsquo;. And with so many of us out of work and struggling financially at the moment, maintaining a gym membership and staying active can seem like much less of a priority. However, even a small amount of activity can make a huge difference to how well you think and feel. In fact, exercise is one of the most powerful tools we have for staying physically and mentally healthy&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t need access to a gym or expensive health club to reap the rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Exercise can help ease depression, stress, and anxiety, and aid in the management of chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. By finding new ways to get moving and stay motivated, you can take charge of your mood and well-being, retain a sense of control during these days of&nbsp;great<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/dealing-with-uncertainty.htm"> </a>uncertainty, and stay on track with your exercise goals even when your normal routine is disrupted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Making an exercise plan to keep you motivated</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Planning is key to developing and maintaining an exercise routine. When making an exercise plan, consider any ongoing health concerns, the time you have available, and your energy and stress levels. Many people report feeling fatigued lately from all the pandemic-related stress, so if you&rsquo;re still juggling teaching your kids and working at home, or are unemployed and&nbsp;worried about finances, this may not be the time to undertake a challenging new fitness plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Whatever your circumstances, set reasonable goals focusing on activities you enjoy. You&rsquo;re more likely to stick to an&nbsp;exercise plan&nbsp;if you start small, celebrate your successes, and build up gradually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Prioritize your workouts.</strong>&nbsp;People who put their fitness activities on the same calendar as their regular appointments tend to stick to their plan. You wouldn&rsquo;t cancel your appointment with your dentist because you were busy with work or just didn&rsquo;t feel like it at that moment. Rather, you&rsquo;d fulfill your obligation and then return to work afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Workout at the time that&rsquo;s right for you.</strong>&nbsp;Many people who maintain a long-term exercise program workout in the mornings. Completing your fitness routine in the morning can energize you and set a positive tone for the rest of the day. Others find it helpful to take a break from work and get moving in the afternoon when their energy is flagging. A burst of activity can stimulate the brain and help you push through the rest of the tasks on your to-do list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Be specific in your goals&mdash;and track your workouts.</strong>&nbsp;Rather than aim to &ldquo;get in better shape,&rdquo; set a concrete goal such as &ldquo;walk 30 minutes in the morning on Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday.&rdquo; Try one of the many fitness trackers or smartphone apps available to keep a record of your progress&mdash;or simply use a calendar to note the length of your workout, distance, and effort level. Tracking your progress can help keep you accountable, provide a sense of accomplishment, and encourage you to keep going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Say it out loud.</strong>&nbsp;Tell a friend what your goals and routines are or post them on social media. You&rsquo;re less likely to skip a session if you know your friends will be asking about how you got on. And if they give you positive feedback, it will give you a boost for your next session. Working out with a buddy can also help keep you on track, even when you can&rsquo;t be physically together. Set up regular times to exercise with each other via a phone or video call&mdash;and offer each other support and encouragement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tips for getting the activity you need&mdash;anywhere</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As always, it&rsquo;s important to be safe, wear good footwear, start slowly, and give your muscles and tendons time to adapt to any new activity. Always seek your physician&rsquo;s advice if you have any underlying health conditions, take medication for a heart problem or to control blood pressure or blood sugar, or experience dizziness, balance problems, or joint issues. And if you feel pain during an activity, STOP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Get outside as much as possible.</strong>&nbsp;Unless your area is under a stay-at-home order or you need to remain in quarantine, try to exercise outside as much as possible. Take a walk, jog, or ride a bike outside, just remember to wear a mask and/or maintain a safe distance from others. The fresh air and sunshine will provide a further boost to your mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Keep your workouts interesting.</strong>&nbsp;Watch your favorite streaming show or listen to a podcast or some great music while working out at home or in a hotel room.&nbsp;While walking, explore a new area in your neighborhood or catch up with a friend on the phone to keep things from getting stale. Or try activity video games or &ldquo;exergames&rdquo; that simulate dancing, skateboarding, soccer, bowling, or tennis. These can be great alternatives if you&rsquo;re unable to participate in the real thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Walk in a new way.</strong>&nbsp;Immerse yourself in the full experience of walking outdoors by adding a&nbsp;mindfulness&nbsp;element. Notice the smell of the air, the variety of flowers and trees and the feel of the sun or the wind as you move. Bringing your attention to these things can give your conscious mind a break from your worries and unleash your creativity. You might find new ideas and solutions coming to you when you weren&rsquo;t even aware you were working on them. If you find you need to up the intensity of your walks, look for hills, do some step ups on the curb at each corner, skip, or even jump up and down the curb a few times (if appropriate for your fitness level and joints).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Try something new.</strong>&nbsp;Always wanted to try barre exercise, line dancing, cardio funk, or HIIT (high-intensity interval training)? Find a free video online, subscribe to one of the many online classes available, or download an app to guide you through home workouts (see the &ldquo;Get more help&rdquo; section below for links). Many people find they are more comfortable trying something new when no one else is watching. You just might find your new passion! Try boxing, Pilates, or yoga. Don&rsquo;t be intimidated to try something new and refine your online search to be more specific to your needs, like &lsquo;yoga for over 50&rsquo;, &lsquo;golf-specific exercises&rsquo; or &lsquo;basic Pilates for beginners&rsquo;. There are many new, and often free, classes being posted daily. Just remember to avoid causing pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Join the kids.</strong>&nbsp;Play catch or tag, go for a bike ride, shoot baskets, or pass the soccer ball with your kids. Taking the focus away from schoolwork or chores and playing together can even help repair a strained relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Miss the gym? Create a home workout area.</strong>&nbsp;If you have space available, designate an inviting area of your home to exercise and keep your equipment handy. Try using resistance bands, water bottles, or your own body weight to perform resistance exercises. You could start by doing push-ups against the wall then progress to doing them against the kitchen counter, the coffee table, and finally the floor. Have stairs in your home? Stair climbing is an efficient strength training activity. Keep one foot on a step and step up and down several times (or try stepping up two steps for an even tougher workout).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Build more movement into your day</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Many of us are spending more and more time sitting&mdash;watching TV, working at the computer, being on Zoom meetings. But even when you&rsquo;re working at home, you can still find ways to incorporate more movement into your day. Try to think of physical activity as a lifestyle choice rather than as a designated event. Getting up every 30 minutes for a quick bout of activity can add up over the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Intersperse household chores into your sitting time: vacuum a room, scrub a sink, do some yard work, or wipe down your appliances.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Move around while you are on a call, stand for an online meeting, do squats or lunges while you&rsquo;re waiting for a meeting to start, or jumping jacks in front of the TV during the credits or commercial breaks.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Try &lsquo;microwave exercises&rsquo; (short bursts of movement) like countertop push-ups while you are waiting for the kettle to boil or toast to pop up.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How much exercise is enough?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When it comes to exercise, something is always better than nothing. Going for a walk around the block will not only stretch your legs but help clear your head as well. It might even inspire you to walk a little further the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">That said, the current recommendation for adults is to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity every week (or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity) with two sessions of strength building activities per week. That&rsquo;s about 30 minutes of movement, five times per week. It&rsquo;s also okay to break it up. Two 15-minute workouts or three 10-minute workouts can benefit you just as much. Include warm up and cool down time as part of your workout&mdash;as well as heavier activities around the house or garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Reward yourself</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When circumstances make it difficult for you to partake in your favorite forms of exercise, it&rsquo;s normal to feel a little frustrated. Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up but keep experimenting with new workouts until you find something that you enjoy. And if you feel your motivation to get moving start to flag, focus on how much better you&rsquo;ll feel after even a little exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It also helps to give yourself an extra treat as a reward for sticking with a new exercise program. Take a long, hot bubble bath, for example, make a fruit smoothie, or call a friend or family member. And remember: the healthy habits you build now can help you to stay healthier and happier far beyond this global pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n');

That&rsquo;s how the inhabitants of Crete, Greece, and southern Italy ate circa 1960, when their rates of chronic disease were among the lowest in the world and their life expectancy among the highest, despite having only limited medical services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">And the real Mediterranean diet is about more than just eating fresh, wholesome food. Daily physical activity and sharing meals with others are vital elements. Together, they can have a profound effect on your mood and mental health and help you foster a deep appreciation for the pleasures of eating healthy and delicious foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Of course, making changes to your diet is rarely easy, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to move away from the convenience of processed and takeout foods. But the Mediterranean diet can be an inexpensive as well as a satisfying and very healthy way to eat. Making the switch from pepperoni and pasta to fish and avocados may take some effort, but you could soon be on a path to a healthier and longer life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Health benefits of a Mediterranean diet</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A traditional Mediterranean diet consisting of large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, fish, and olive oil&mdash;coupled with physical activity&mdash;can reduce your risk of serious mental and physical health problems by:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Preventing heart disease and strokes.</strong>&nbsp;Following a Mediterranean diet limits your intake of refined breads, processed foods, and red meat, and encourages drinking red wine instead of hard liquor&mdash;all factors that can help&nbsp;prevent heart disease and stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Keeping you agile.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re an older adult, the nutrients gained with a Mediterranean diet may reduce your risk of developing muscle weakness and other signs of frailty by about 70 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Reducing the risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</strong>&nbsp;Research suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cholesterol, blood sugar levels, and overall blood vessel health, which in turn may reduce your risk of&nbsp;Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or dementia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Halving the risk of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</strong>. The high levels of antioxidants in the Mediterranean diet can prevent cells from undergoing a damaging process called oxidative stress, thereby cutting the risk of&nbsp;Parkinson&rsquo;s disease&nbsp;in half.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Increasing longevity.</strong>&nbsp;By reducing your risk of developing heart disease or cancer with the Mediterranean diet, you&rsquo;re reducing your risk of death at any age by 20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Protecting against type 2 diabetes.</strong>&nbsp;A Mediterranean diet is&nbsp;rich in fiber&nbsp;which digests slowly, prevents huge swings in blood sugar, and can help you maintain a healthy weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Myths and facts about the Mediterranean diet</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Following a Mediterranean diet has many benefits, but there are still a lot of misconceptions on exactly how to take advantage of the lifestyle to lead a healthier, longer life.

Instead, pasta is usually a side dish with about a 1/2-cup to 1-cup serving size. The rest of their plate consists of salads, vegetables, fish or a small portion of organic, grass-fed meat, and perhaps one slice of bread.</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Myth 4: The Mediterranean diet is only about the food.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n			<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The food is a huge part of the diet, yes, but don&rsquo;t overlook the other ways the Mediterraneans live their lives. When they sit down for a meal, they don&rsquo;t sit in front of a television or eat in a rush; they sit down for a relaxed, leisurely meal with others, which may be just as important for your health as what&rsquo;s on your plate.

Salads, soups, and crudit&eacute; platters are also great ways to load up on vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Always eat breakfast.</strong>&nbsp;Fruit, whole grains, and other fiber-rich foods are a great way to start your day, keeping you pleasantly full for hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat seafood twice a week.&nbsp;</strong>Fish such as tuna, salmon, herring, sablefish (black cod), and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and shellfish like mussels, oysters, and clams have similar benefits for brain and heart health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cook a vegetarian meal one night a week.</strong>&nbsp;If it&rsquo;s helpful, you can jump on the &ldquo;Meatless Mondays&rdquo; trend of foregoing meat on the first day of the week. Or simply pick a day where you build meals around beans, whole grains, and vegetables. Once you get the hang of it, try two nights a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Enjoy dairy products in moderation.</strong>&nbsp;The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends limiting saturated fat to no more than 10% of your daily calories (about 200 calories for most people). That still allows you to enjoy dairy products such as natural (unprocessed) cheese and Greek or plain yogurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>For dessert, eat fresh fruit.&nbsp;</strong>Instead of ice cream, cake or other baked goods, opt for strawberries, fresh figs, grapes, or apples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Use good fats.</strong>&nbsp;Extra-virgin olive oil, nuts, sunflower seeds, olives, and avocados are great sources of&nbsp;healthy fats&nbsp;for your daily meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Make mealtimes a social experience</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The simple act of talking to a friend or loved over the dinner table can play a big role in&nbsp;relieving stress&nbsp;and boosting mood. Eating with others can also prevent overeating, making it as healthy for your waistline as it is for your outlook. Switch off the TV and computer, put away your smartphone, and connect to someone over a meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Gather the family together</strong>&nbsp;and stay up to date with each other&rsquo;s daily lives. Regular family meals provide comfort to kids and are a great way to monitor their eating habits as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Share meals with others to expand your social network.</strong>&nbsp;If you live alone, cook a little extra and invite a friend, coworker, or neighbor to join you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cook with others.</strong>&nbsp;Invite a friend to share shopping and&nbsp;cooking responsibilities&nbsp;for a Mediterranean meal.

It&rsquo;s a vital nutrient required for building, maintaining, and repairing tissues, cells, and organs throughout the body. While it&rsquo;s in many of the foods that we eat every day, for something so common it&rsquo;s often a misunderstood part of our diets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When you eat protein, it is broken down into the 20 amino acids that are the body&rsquo;s basic building blocks for growth and energy.

While too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, diabetes, and some other conditions, eating the right amount of high-quality protein:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Keeps your immune system functioning properly, maintains heart health and your respiratory system, and speeds recovery after exercise.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Is vital to the growth and development of children and for maintaining&nbsp;health in your senior years.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Can help reduce your risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Can help you think clearly and may&nbsp;improve recall.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Can improve your mood and boost your resistance to stress, anxiety, and depression.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">May help you&nbsp;maintain a healthy weight&nbsp;by curbing appetite, making you feel full longer, and fueling you with extra energy for exercising.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As well as being imperative to feeling healthy and energetic, protein is also important to the way you look. Eating high-quality protein can help you maintain healthy skin, nails, and hair, build muscle, and maintain lean body mass while dieting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While most people eating a Western diet get a sufficient&nbsp;<em>quantity&nbsp;</em>of protein each day, many of us are not getting the&nbsp;<em>quality</em>&nbsp;of protein we need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>High-quality vs. low-quality protein</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Distinguishing between industrially raised meat and&nbsp;organic, grass-fed meat&nbsp;is only part of separating low- and high-quality sources of protein.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">While some processed or lunch meats, for example, can be a good source of protein, many are loaded with salt, which can cause high&nbsp;blood<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/blood-pressure-and-your-brain.htm"> </a>pressure&nbsp;and lead to other health problems.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Processed meats have also been linked with an increased risk of cancer, likely due to the substances used in the processing of the meat.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The key to ensuring you eat sufficient high-quality protein is to include different types in your diet, rather than relying on just red or processed meat.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Good sources of high-quality protein</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fish.&nbsp;</strong>Most seafood is high in protein and low in saturated fat. Fish such as salmon, trout, sardines, anchovies, sablefish (black cod), and herring are also high in omega-3 fatty acids. Experts recommend eating seafood at least twice a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Poultry.</strong>&nbsp;Removing the skin from chicken and turkey can substantially reduce the saturated fat. In the U.S., non-organic poultry may also contain antibiotics and been raised on GMO feed grown with pesticides, so opt for organic and free-range if possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Dairy products.</strong>&nbsp;Products such as skim milk, cheese, and yoghurt offer lots of healthy protein. Beware of added sugar in low-fat yoghurts and flavored milk, though, and skip processed cheese that often contains non-dairy ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Beans.&nbsp;</strong>Beans and peas are packed full of both protein and fiber. Add them to salads, soups and stews to boost your protein intake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Nuts and seeds.</strong>&nbsp;As well as being rich sources of protein, nuts and seeds are also high in&nbsp;fiber&nbsp;and &ldquo;good&rdquo; fats. Add to salads or keep handy for snacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Tofu and soy products.</strong>&nbsp;Non-GMO tofu and soy are excellent red meat alternatives, high in protein and low in fat. Try a &ldquo;meatless Monday,&rdquo; plant-based protein sources are often less expensive than meat so it can be as&nbsp;good for your wallet&nbsp;as it is for your health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tips to increase your protein intake</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">To include more high-quality protein in your diet, try replacing&nbsp;processed carbs&nbsp;with high-quality protein. It can reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke, and you&rsquo;ll also feel full longer, which can help you maintain a healthy weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Reduce the amount of processed carbohydrates you consume&mdash;from foods such as pastries, cakes, pizza, cookies and chips&mdash;and replace them with fish, beans, nuts, seeds, peas, chicken, low-fat dairy, and soy and tofu products.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Snack on nuts and seeds instead of chips, replace a baked dessert with Greek yogurt, or swap out slices of pizza for a grilled chicken breast and a side of beans.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>To avoid problems when increasing protein intake</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Choose unsalted nuts and seeds, to reduce your daily sodium intake.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">When shopping for canned beans, choose the low sodium versions.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Adding more protein to your diet can increase urine output, so drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Increasing protein can also cause calcium loss so make sure to&nbsp;get plenty of calcium&nbsp;(1,000 to 1,200 mg per day).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Protein powders, shakes, and bars</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In most cases, consuming the right balance of whole foods each day will provide you with all the nutrients you need, negating the need for protein supplements. However, you may benefit from supplementing your diet if you&rsquo;re:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">A teenager who is growing and exercising a lot.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">An adult switching to a vegan diet&mdash;eliminating meat, chicken, fish, and even dairy and eggs from your diet.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">An older adult with a small appetite who finds it difficult to eat your protein requirements in whole foods.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Starting or increasing a&nbsp;regular workout program, trying to add muscle, recovering from a sports injury, or find you feel weak while exercising or lifting weights.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Using protein supplements</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Protein supplements come in various forms including powders you mix with milk or water, pre-mixed, ready-to-drink shakes, or in bars. The most common types of protein used are whey, casein, and soy. Whey and casein are milk-based proteins, while soy is the better choice for vegans or anyone with a dairy allergy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Safety concerns.&nbsp;</strong>Protein supplements may not be safe for older people with renal disease or people who have recently undergone surgery on the digestive system. Some ingredients may even interact with prescription medication, so check with your doctor or pharmacist before using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Drink plenty of water&nbsp;</strong>to stay hydrated and make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough calcium in your diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Look out for extra ingredients.&nbsp;</strong>Many protein bars are packed with&nbsp;carbs and added sugar.</p>\r\n'),

Rather, it&rsquo;s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Healthy eating doesn&rsquo;t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, you&rsquo;re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain food is good for you, you&rsquo;ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it&rsquo;s your overall dietary pattern that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create&mdash;and stick to&mdash;a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">The fundamentals of healthy eating</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don&rsquo;t need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Protein</strong>&nbsp;gives you the energy to get up and go&mdash;and keep going&mdash;while also supporting mood and cognitive function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we age. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to eat more animal products&mdash;a variety of plant-based sources of protein each day can ensure your body gets all the essential protein it needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fat</strong>. Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. In fact, healthy fats&mdash;such as omega-3s&mdash;are vital to your physical and emotional health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve your mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fiber</strong>. Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can help you stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can also improve your skin and even help you to lose weight.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Calcium</strong>. As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. Whatever your age or gender, it&rsquo;s vital to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and get enough magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Carbohydrates</strong>&nbsp;are one of your body&rsquo;s main sources of energy. But most should come from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and refined carbs. Cutting back on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar, fluctuations in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Making the switch to a healthy diet</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Switching to a healthy diet doesn&rsquo;t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don&rsquo;t have to be perfect, you don&rsquo;t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don&rsquo;t have to change everything all at once&mdash;that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping your goals modest can help you achieve more in the long term without feeling deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul. Think of planning a healthy diet as a number of small, manageable steps&mdash;like adding a salad to your diet once a day. As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Setting yourself up for success</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">To set yourself up for success, try to keep things simple. Eating a healthier diet doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated. Instead of being overly concerned with counting calories, for example, think of your diet in terms of color, variety, and freshness. Focus on avoiding packaged and processed foods and opting for more fresh ingredients whenever possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Prepare more of your own meals</strong>.&nbsp;Cooking more meals at home&nbsp;can help you take charge of what you&rsquo;re eating and better monitor exactly what goes into your food. You&rsquo;ll eat fewer calories and avoid the chemical additives, added sugar, and unhealthy fats of packaged and takeout foods that can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make the right changes</strong>. When cutting back on unhealthy foods in your diet, it&rsquo;s important to replace them with healthy alternatives. Replacing dangerous trans fats with healthy fats (such as switching fried chicken for grilled salmon) will make a positive difference to your health. Switching animal fats for refined carbohydrates, though (such as switching your breakfast bacon for a donut), won&rsquo;t lower your risk for heart disease or improve your mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Read the labels</strong>. It&rsquo;s important to be aware of what&rsquo;s in your food as manufacturers often hide large amounts of sugar or unhealthy fats in packaged food, even food claiming to be healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Focus on how you feel after eating</strong>. This will help foster healthy new habits and tastes. The healthier the food you eat, the better you&rsquo;ll feel after a meal. The more junk food you eat, the more likely you are to feel uncomfortable, nauseous, or drained of energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Drink plenty of water</strong>. Water helps flush our systems of waste products and toxins, yet many of us go through life dehydrated&mdash;causing tiredness, low energy, and headaches. It&rsquo;s common to mistake thirst for hunger, so staying well hydrated will also help you make healthier food choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Moderation: important to any healthy diet</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">What is moderation? In essence, it means eating only as much food as your body needs. You should feel satisfied at the end of a meal, but not stuffed. For many of us, moderation means eating less than we do now. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean eliminating the foods you love. Eating bacon for breakfast once a week, for example, could be considered moderation if you follow it with a healthy lunch and dinner&mdash;but not if you follow it with a box of donuts and a sausage pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Try not to think of certain foods as &ldquo;off-limits.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;When you ban certain foods, it&rsquo;s natural to want those foods more, and then feel like a failure if you give in to temptation. Start by reducing portion sizes of unhealthy foods and not eating them as often. As you reduce your intake of unhealthy foods, you may find yourself craving them less or thinking of them as only occasional indulgences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Think smaller portions</strong>. Serving sizes have ballooned recently. When dining out, choose a starter instead of an entree, split a dish with a friend, and don&rsquo;t order supersized anything. At home, visual cues can help with portion sizes. Your serving of meat, fish, or chicken should be the size of a deck of cards and half a cup of mashed potato, rice, or pasta is about the size of a traditional light bulb. By serving your meals on smaller plates or in bowls, you can trick your brain into thinking it&rsquo;s a larger portion. If you don&rsquo;t feel satisfied at the end of a meal, add more leafy greens or round off the meal with fruit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Take your time</strong>. It&rsquo;s important to slow down and&nbsp;think about food&nbsp;as nourishment rather than just something to gulp down in between meetings or on the way to pick up the kids. It actually takes a few minutes for your brain to tell your body that it has had enough food, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat with others whenever possible</strong>. Eating alone, especially in front of the TV or computer, often leads to mindless overeating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Limit snack foods in the home.</strong>&nbsp;Be careful about the foods you keep at hand. It&rsquo;s more challenging to eat in moderation if you have unhealthy snacks and treats at the ready. Instead, surround yourself with healthy choices and when you&rsquo;re ready to reward yourself with a special treat, go out and get it then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Control emotional eating.</strong>&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t always eat just to satisfy hunger. Many of us also turn to food to relieve stress or cope with unpleasant emotions such as sadness, loneliness, or boredom. But by learning healthier ways to manage stress and emotions, you can&nbsp;regain control over the food you eat and your feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Add more fruit and vegetables to your diet</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Focus on eating the recommended daily amount of&nbsp;<strong>at least five servings</strong>&nbsp;of fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up and help you cut back on unhealthy foods. A serving is half a cup of raw fruit or veg or a small apple or banana, for example. Most of us need to double the amount we currently eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">To increase your intake:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Add antioxidant-rich berries to your favorite breakfast cereal</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Eat a medley of sweet fruit&mdash;oranges, mangos, pineapple, grapes&mdash;for dessert</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Swap your usual rice or pasta side dish for a colorful salad</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Instead of eating processed snack foods, snack on vegetables such as carrots, snow peas, or cherry tomatoes along with a spicy hummus dip or peanut butter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">How to make vegetables tasty</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While plain salads and steamed veggies can quickly become bland, there are plenty of ways to add taste to your vegetable dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Add color</strong>. Not only do brighter, deeper colored vegetables contain higher concentrations of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but they can vary the flavor and make meals more visually appealing. Add color using fresh or sundried tomatoes, glazed carrots or beets, roasted red cabbage wedges, yellow squash, or sweet, colorful peppers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Liven up salad greens</strong>. Branch out beyond lettuce. Kale, arugula, spinach, mustard greens, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage are all packed with nutrients. To add flavor to your salad greens, try drizzling with olive oil, adding a spicy dressing, or sprinkling with almond slices, chickpeas, a little bacon, parmesan, or goat cheese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Satisfy your sweet tooth</strong>. Naturally sweet vegetables&mdash;such as carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, yams, onions, bell peppers, and squash&mdash;add sweetness to your meals and reduce your cravings for added sugar. Add them to soups, stews, or pasta sauces for a satisfying sweet kick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cook green beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus in new ways</strong>. Instead of boiling or steaming these healthy sides, try grilling, roasting, or pan frying them with chili flakes, garlic, shallots, mushrooms, or onion. Or marinate in tangy lemon or lime before cooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n');

For years we&rsquo;ve been told that eating fat will add inches to your waistline, raise cholesterol, and cause a myriad of health problems. But now we know that not all fat is the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&ldquo;Bad&rdquo; fats, such as artificial trans fats and saturated fats, are guilty of the unhealthy things all fats have been blamed for&mdash;weight gain, clogged arteries, an increased risk of certain diseases, and so forth. But &ldquo;good&rdquo; fats such as unsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids have the opposite effect. In fact, healthy fats play a huge role in helping you manage your moods, stay on top of your mental game, fight fatigue, and even control your weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">By understanding the difference between good and bad fats and how to include more healthy fat in your diet, you can improve how well you think and feel, boost your energy, and even trim your waistline.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Dietary fat and cholesterol</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Dietary fat plays a major role in your cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is a fatty, wax-like substance that your body needs to function properly. In and of itself, cholesterol isn&rsquo;t bad. But when you get too much of it, it can have a negative impact on your health. As with dietary fat, there are good and bad types of cholesterol.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">HDL cholesterol is the &ldquo;good&rdquo; kind of cholesterol found in your blood.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">LDL cholesterol is the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; kind.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The key is to keep LDL levels low and HDL high, which may protect against heart disease and stroke.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Conversely, high levels of LDL cholesterol can clog arteries and low HDL can be a marker for increased cardiovascular risk.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Rather than the amount of cholesterol you eat, the biggest influence on your cholesterol levels is the type of fats you consume. So instead of counting cholesterol, it&rsquo;s important to focus on replacing bad fats with good fats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Good fats vs. bad fats</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Since fat is an important part of a healthy diet, rather than adopting a low-fat diet, it&rsquo;s more important to focus on eating more beneficial &ldquo;good&rdquo; fats and limiting harmful &ldquo;bad&rdquo; fats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Healthy or &ldquo;good&rdquo; fats</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats</strong>&nbsp;are known as the &ldquo;good fats&rdquo; because they are good for your heart, your cholesterol, and your overall health. These fats can help to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Lower bad LDL cholesterol levels, while increasing good HDL.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Prevent abnormal heart rhythms.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Lower triglycerides associated with heart disease and fight inflammation.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Lower&nbsp;blood pressure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Adding more of these healthy fats to your diet may also help to make you feel more satisfied after a meal, reducing hunger and thus promoting&nbsp;weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Monounsaturated fat</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; good sources include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Olive, peanut, and sesame oils</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Avocados</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Olives</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Nuts (almonds, peanuts, macadamia, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Peanut butter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Polyunsaturated fat</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; good sources include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Flaxseed</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Walnuts</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, sardines) and fish oil</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Soybean and safflower oil</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Soymilk</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Tofu</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Unhealthy or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; fats</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Trans fat</strong>. Small amounts of naturally occurring trans fats can be found in meat and dairy products but it&rsquo;s artificial trans fats that are considered dangerous. This is the worst type of fat since it not only raises bad LDL cholesterol but also lowers good HDL levels. Artificial trans fats can also create inflammation, which is linked to heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions and contributes to insulin resistance, which increases your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has effectively outlawed the use of artificial trans-fats in commercially prepared food and the World Health Organization (WHO) has called on other governments around the world to eliminate the use of trans fats by 2023. However, products made before the FDA ban may still be available for sale. Since products can be listed as having &ldquo;zero trans fats&rdquo; even if they contain up to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, it&rsquo;s still important to carefully read food labels. Look for ingredients referred to as &ldquo;partially hydrogenated oils.&rdquo; These hidden sources of artificial trans fats can add up quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Trans fat</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; primary sources include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Commercially-baked pastries, cookies, doughnuts, muffins, cakes, pizza dough</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Packaged snack foods (crackers, microwave popcorn, chips)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Stick margarine, vegetable shortening</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fried foods (French fries, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, breaded fish)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Anything containing hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, even if it claims to be &ldquo;trans fat-free&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Saturated fat.</strong>&nbsp;While not as harmful as trans fat, saturated fat can raise bad LDL cholesterol and too much can negatively impact heart health, so it&rsquo;s best consumed in moderation. While there&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>no need to cut out all</strong>&nbsp;saturated fat from your diet, most nutrition experts recommend limiting it to 10% of your daily calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Saturated fat</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; primary sources include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Red meat (beef, lamb, pork)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Chicken skin</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Whole-fat dairy products (milk, cream, cheese)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Butter</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Ice cream</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Tropical oils such as coconut and palm oil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Healthy fats: The power of omega-3s</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat and are especially beneficial to your health. There are different types of omega-3s: EPA and DHA are found in fish and algae and have the most health benefits, while ALA comes from plants and is a less potent form of omega-3, although the body does convert ALA to EPA and DHA at low rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Research has shown that a diet rich in omega-3s may help to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Prevent and reduce&nbsp;symptoms of depression, ADHD, and bipolar disorder.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Protect against memory loss and&nbsp;dementia.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and cancer.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Ease arthritis, joint pain, and inflammatory skin conditions.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Support a healthy pregnancy.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Battle fatigue,&nbsp;sharpen your memory, and balance your mood.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">How much omega-3s do you need?</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The American Heart Association recommends that people with documented heart disease get about 1 gram of EPA plus DHA per day. For the rest of us, the AHA recommends eating at least two 3.5 oz. (100 g) servings of fish per week.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, herring, lake trout, and sardines&nbsp;are highest in omega-3 fatty acids.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">If you don&rsquo;t eat fish, you may want to take an omega-3 supplement, widely available over the counter.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Try to also include a variety of ALA-rich oils, nuts, seeds, and vegetables in your diet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Omega-3 supplements</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While omega-3s are best obtained through food, there are many omega-3 and fish oil supplements available. Fish oil contains no mercury (mercury binds to protein, not fat) and very low amounts of other contaminants.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">One capsule per day usually supplies about 200 to 400 mg of EPA plus DHA, and should be enough for most people.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">If you need to substantially lower your triglycerides, your doctor may recommend prescription fish oil, which has been concentrated to contain about 900 mg of EPA plus DHA per capsule.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">For strict vegetarians or vegans, as well as obtaining ALA from food sources, look for capsules containing DHA and EPA extracted from algae, the original source of omega-3s for fish.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Tips for taking supplements</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For some, fish oil capsules can be hard to swallow and may leave a fishy aftertaste.

Oils such as corn, sunflower, safflower, and soybean contain omega-6, a type of polyunsaturated fat that may help to reduce insulin resistance and inflammation.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Use naturally occurring, unhydrogenated vegetable oils such as olive, canola, and sunflower oil whenever possible.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">When using olive oil, opt for &ldquo;extra virgin,&rdquo; which may have additional heart benefits over regular olive oil.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Less processed oils, such as cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil, contain potentially beneficial phytochemicals.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tips for adding more healthy fats to your diet</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Instead of obsessively counting fat grams, aim for a diet rich in a variety of vegetables, fruit, nuts, and beans, with two or more weekly servings of fatty fish, moderate amounts of dairy, small amounts of red meat, and only occasional fried or processed meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This might mean replacing fried chicken with grilled chicken, swapping out some of the red meat you eat with other sources of protein such as fish, chicken, or beans, or using olive oil rather than butter. Following a&nbsp;Mediterranean die<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/diets/the-mediterranean-diet.htm">t</a>&nbsp;can also help ensure you&rsquo;re getting enough good fats in your diet and limiting the bad ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Limit your intake of saturated fats</strong>&nbsp;by replacing some of the red meat you eat with beans, nuts, poultry, and fish, and switching from whole milk dairy to lower fat versions. But don&rsquo;t make the mistake of replacing saturated fat with&nbsp;refined carbohydrates and sugary foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat omega-3 fats every day.</strong>&nbsp;Include a variety of fish sources as well as plant sources such as walnuts, ground flax seeds, flaxseed oil, canola oil, and soybean oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cook with olive oil.</strong>&nbsp;Use olive oil for stovetop cooking rather than butter, stick margarine, or lard. For baking, try canola oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat more avocados.</strong>&nbsp;Try them in sandwiches or salads or make guacamole. Along with being loaded with heart- and brain-healthy fats, they make for a filling meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Reach for the nuts.</strong>&nbsp;You can add nuts to vegetable dishes, use them instead of breadcrumbs on chicken or fish, or make your own trail mix with nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Snack on olives.</strong>&nbsp;Olives are high in healthy monounsaturated fats and make for a low-calorie snack. Try them plain or make a tapenade for dipping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Dress your own salad.</strong>&nbsp;Commercial salad dressings are often high in unhealthy fat or added sugars. Create your own healthy dressings with olive, flaxseed, or sesame oils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n'),

They digest quickly and their high glycemic index causes unhealthy spikes in blood sugar levels. They can also cause fluctuations in mood and energy and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When you eat refined or simple carbs, your bloodstream is flooded with sugar which triggers a surge of insulin to clear the sugar from your blood. All this insulin can leave you feeling hungry soon after a meal, often craving more sugary carbs. This can cause you to overeat, put on weight, and over time lead to insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. Diets high in refined carbs and sugar have also been linked to&nbsp;high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, hyperactivity, mood disorders, and even suicide in teenagers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Why is cutting down on sugar and refined carbs so difficult?</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For many of us, cutting back on sugary treats and overcoming our carb cravings can seem like a daunting task. As well as being present in obvious foods such as sugary snacks, desserts, and candies, sugar is also hidden in much of the processed food we eat&mdash;from soda, coffee and fruit drinks to bread, pasta sauce, and frozen dinners. But cutting back on these diet saboteurs doesn&rsquo;t mean feeling unsatisfied or never enjoying comfort food again. The key is to choose the right carbs. Complex, unrefined, or &ldquo;good&rdquo; carbs such as vegetables, whole grains, and naturally sweet fruit digest slower, resulting in stable blood sugar and less fat accumulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">By focusing on whole foods and complex, unrefined carbs, you can reduce your intake of sugar and simple carbs, keep your blood sugar stable,&nbsp;maintain a<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/diets/how-to-lose-weight-and-keep-it-off.htm"> </a>healthy weight, and still find ways to satisfy your sweet tooth. You&rsquo;ll not only feel healthier and more energetic, you could also shed that stubborn belly fat so many of us struggle with.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Good carbs vs. bad carbs</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Carbohydrates are one of your body&rsquo;s main sources of energy. Health organizations such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend that 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates. However, the majority of these should be from complex, unrefined carbs rather than refined carbs (including starches such as potatoes and corn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Unlike simple carbs, complex carbohydrates are digested slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar. They&rsquo;re usually&nbsp;high in nutrients and fiber, which can help prevent serious disease, aid with weight-loss, and improve your energy levels. In general, &ldquo;good&rdquo; carbohydrates have a lower glycemic load and can even help guard against type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Good carbs include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Unrefined whole grains</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; whole wheat or multigrain bread, brown rice, barley, quinoa, bran cereal, oatmeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Non-starchy vegetables</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; spinach, green beans, Brussels sprouts, celery, tomatoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Legumes</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; kidney beans, baked beans, peas, lentils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Nuts</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; peanuts, cashews, walnuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fruit</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; apples, berries, citrus fruit, bananas, pears.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Switching to good carbs</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While there are many health benefits to switching from simple to complex carbs, you don&rsquo;t have to consign yourself to never again eating French fries or a slice of white bread. After all, when you ban certain foods, it&rsquo;s natural to crave those foods even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Instead, make refined carbs and sugary foods an occasional indulgence rather than a regular part of your diet. As you reduce your intake of these unhealthy foods, you&rsquo;ll likely find yourself craving them less and less.</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td colspan="2" style="text-align:justify"><strong>Choosing healthier carbs</strong></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Instead of&hellip;</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Try&hellip;</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">White rice</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Brown or wild rice, riced cauliflower</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">White potatoes (including fries and mashed potatoes)</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Cauliflower mash, sweet potato</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Regular pasta</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Whole-wheat pasta, spaghetti squash</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">White bread</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Whole-wheat or whole-grain bread</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Sugary breakfast cereal</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">High-fiber, low-sugar cereal</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Instant oatmeal</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Steel-cut or rolled oats</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Cornflakes</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Low-sugar bran flakes</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Corn</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Leafy greens</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Corn or potato chips</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:justify">Nuts, or raw veggies for dipping</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Added sugar is just empty calories</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Your body gets all the sugar it needs from the sugar that naturally occurs in food&mdash;fructose in fruit or lactose in milk, for example. All the sugar added to processed food offers no nutritional value&mdash;but just means a lot of empty calories that can sabotage any healthy diet, contribute to weight gain, and increase your risk for serious health problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Again, it&rsquo;s unrealistic to try to eliminate all sugar and empty calories from your diet. The American Heart Association recommends limiting the amount of added sugars you consume to no more than 100 calories per day (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams of sugar) for women and 150 calories per day (9 teaspoons or 36 grams) for men. If that still sounds like a lot, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that a 12-ounce soda contains up to 10 teaspoons of added sugar&mdash;some shakes and sweetened coffee drinks even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The average American&nbsp;currently consumes 19.5 teaspoons (82 grams) of added sugar each day, often without realizing it. By becoming more aware of the sugar in your diet, you can cut down to the recommended levels and make a huge difference to the way you look, think, and feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">How to cut down on sugar</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Slowly reduce the sugar in your diet a little at a time</strong>&nbsp;to give your taste buds time to adjust and wean yourself off the craving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cook more at home</strong>. By&nbsp;preparing more of your own food, you can ensure that you and your family eat fresh, wholesome meals without added sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Give recipes a makeover</strong>. Many dessert recipes taste just as good with less sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Avoid sugary drinks&mdash;even &ldquo;diet&rdquo; versions</strong>. Artificial sweetener can still trigger sugar cravings that contribute to weight gain. Instead of soda, try adding a splash of fruit juice to sparkling water. Or blend skim milk with a banana or berries for a delicious, healthy smoothie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Avoid processed or packaged foods</strong>. About 75% of packaged food in the U.S. contains added sugar&mdash;including canned soups, frozen dinners, and low-fat meals&mdash;that can quickly add up to unhealthy amounts. The situation isn&rsquo;t much better in many other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Be careful when eating out</strong>. Most gravy, dressings, and sauces are packed with sugar, so ask for it to be served on the side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Eat healthier snacks</strong>. Cut down on sweet snacks such as candy, chocolate, and cakes. Instead, satisfy your sweet tooth with naturally sweet food such as fruit, peppers, or natural peanut butter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Create your own frozen treats</strong>. Freeze pure fruit juice in an ice-cube tray with plastic spoons as popsicle handles. Or make frozen fruit kabobs using pineapple chunks, bananas, grapes, and berries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Check labels</strong>&nbsp;of all the packaged food you buy. Choose low-sugar products&mdash;but be aware that manufacturers often try to hide sugar on labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How to spot hidden sugar in your food</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Being smart about sweets is only part of the battle of reducing sugar and simple carbs in your diet. Sugar is also hidden in many packaged foods, fast food meals, and grocery store staples such as bread, cereals, canned goods, pasta sauce, margarine, instant mashed potatoes, frozen dinners, low-fat meals, and ketchup. The first step is to spot hidden sugar on food labels, which can take some sleuthing:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers provide the total amount of sugar on their labels but do not have to differentiate between added sugar and sugar that is naturally in the food.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Added sugars are listed in the ingredients but aren&rsquo;t always easily recognizable as such. While sugar, honey, or molasses are easy enough to spot, added sugar could also be listed as corn sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup, evaporated cane juice, agave nectar, cane crystals, invert sugar, or any kind of fructose, dextrose, lactose, maltose, or syrup.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">While you&rsquo;d expect sugary foods to have sugar listed near the top of their list of ingredients, manufacturers often use different types of added sugars which then appear scattered down the list. But all these little doses of different sweeteners can add up to a lot of extra sugar and empty calories!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n'),

Many of us also turn to food for comfort, stress relief, or to reward ourselves. And when we do, we tend to reach for junk food, sweets, and other comforting but unhealthy foods. You might reach for a pint of ice cream when you&rsquo;re feeling down, order a pizza if you&rsquo;re bored or lonely, or swing by the drive-through after a stressful day at work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Emotional eating is using food to make yourself feel better&mdash;to fill emotional needs, rather than your stomach. Unfortunately, emotional eating doesn&rsquo;t fix emotional problems. In fact, it usually makes you feel worse. Afterward, not only does the original emotional issue remain, but you also feel guilty for overeating.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">The emotional eating cycle</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Occasionally using food as a pick-me-up, a reward, or to celebrate isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. But when eating is your primary emotional coping mechanism&mdash;when your first impulse is to open the refrigerator whenever you&rsquo;re stressed, upset, angry, lonely, exhausted, or bored&mdash;you get stuck in an unhealthy cycle where the real feeling or problem is never addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><img alt="Emotional eating cycle" height="506" src="https://www.helpguide.org/wp-content/uploads/emotional-eating-cycle-564.jpg" width="564" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Emotional hunger can&rsquo;t be filled with food. Eating may feel good in the moment, but the feelings that triggered the eating are still there. And you often feel worse than you did before because of the unnecessary calories you&rsquo;ve just consumed. You beat yourself for messing up and not having more willpower.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">The difference between emotional hunger and physical hunger</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before you can break free from the cycle of emotional eating, you first need to learn how to distinguish between emotional and physical hunger. This can be trickier than it sounds, especially if you regularly use food to deal with your feelings. Emotional hunger can be powerful, so it&rsquo;s easy to mistake it for physical hunger. But there are clues you can look for to help you tell physical and emotional hunger apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Emotional hunger comes on suddenly.&nbsp;</strong>It hits you in an instant and feels overwhelming and urgent. Physical hunger, on the other hand, comes on more gradually. The urge to eat doesn&rsquo;t feel as dire or demand instant satisfaction (unless you haven&rsquo;t eaten for a very long time).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Emotional hunger craves specific comfort foods.&nbsp;</strong>When you&rsquo;re physically hungry, almost anything sounds good&mdash;including healthy stuff like vegetables. But emotional hunger craves junk food or sugary snacks that provide an instant rush. You feel like you&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;cheesecake or pizza, and nothing else will do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Emotional hunger often leads to mindless eating.&nbsp;</strong>Before you know it, you&rsquo;ve eaten a whole bag of chips or an entire pint of ice cream without really paying attention or fully enjoying it. When you&rsquo;re eating in response to physical hunger, you&rsquo;re typically more aware of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Emotional hunger isn&rsquo;t satisfied once you&rsquo;re full.</strong>&nbsp;You keep wanting more and more, often eating until you&rsquo;re uncomfortably stuffed. Physical hunger, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t need to be stuffed. You feel satisfied when your stomach is full.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Identify your emotional eating triggers</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The first step in putting a stop to emotional eating is identifying your personal triggers. What situations, places, or feelings make you reach for the comfort of food? Most emotional eating is linked to unpleasant feelings, but it can also be triggered by positive emotions, such as rewarding yourself for achieving a goal or celebrating a holiday or happy event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Common causes of emotional eating</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Stress.&nbsp;</strong>Ever notice how stress makes you hungry? It&rsquo;s not just in your mind. When stress is chronic, as it so often is in our chaotic, fast-paced world, your body produces high levels of the stress hormone, cortisol. Cortisol triggers cravings for salty, sweet, and fried foods&mdash;foods that give you a burst of energy and pleasure. The more&nbsp;uncontrolled stress in your life, the more likely you are to turn to food for emotional relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Boredom or feelings of emptiness.&nbsp;</strong>Do you ever eat simply to give yourself something to do, to relieve boredom, or as a way to fill a void in your life? You feel unfulfilled and empty, and food is a way to occupy your mouth and your time. In the moment, it fills you up and distracts you from underlying feelings of purposelessness and dissatisfaction with your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Childhood habits.&nbsp;</strong>Think back to your childhood memories of food. Did your parents reward good behavior with ice cream, take you out for pizza when you got a good report card, or serve you sweets when you were feeling sad? These habits can often carry over into adulthood. Or your eating may be driven by nostalgia&mdash;for cherished memories of grilling burgers in the backyard with your dad or baking and eating cookies with your mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Social influences.&nbsp;</strong>Getting together with other people for a meal is a great way to relieve stress, but it can also lead to overeating. It&rsquo;s easy to overindulge simply because the food is there or because everyone else is eating. You may also overeat in social situations out of nervousness. Or perhaps your family or circle of friends encourages you to overeat, and it&rsquo;s easier to go along with the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Find other ways to feed your feelings</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you don&rsquo;t know how to manage your emotions in a way that doesn&rsquo;t involve food, you won&rsquo;t be able to control your eating habits for very long. Diets so often fail because they offer logical nutritional advice which only works if you have conscious control over your eating habits. It doesn&rsquo;t work when emotions hijack the process, demanding an immediate payoff with food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In order to stop emotional eating, you have to find other ways to fulfill yourself emotionally. It&rsquo;s not enough to understand the cycle of emotional eating or even to understand your triggers, although that&rsquo;s a huge first step. You need alternatives to food that you can turn to for emotional fulfillment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Alternatives to emotional eating</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>If you&rsquo;re depressed or lonely,</strong>&nbsp;call someone who always makes you feel better, play with your dog or cat, or look at a favorite photo or cherished memento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>If you&rsquo;re anxious,</strong>&nbsp;expend your nervous energy by dancing to your favorite song, squeezing a stress ball, or taking a brisk walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>If you&rsquo;re exhausted,</strong>&nbsp;treat yourself with a hot cup of tea, take a bath, light some scented candles, or wrap yourself in a warm blanket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>If you&rsquo;re bored,</strong>&nbsp;read a good book, watch a comedy show, explore the outdoors, or turn to an activity you enjoy (woodworking, playing the guitar, shooting hoops, scrapbooking, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Pause when cravings hit and check in with yourself</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Most emotional eaters feel powerless over their food cravings. When the urge to eat hits, it&rsquo;s all you can think about. You feel an almost unbearable tension that demands to be fed, right now! Because you&rsquo;ve tried to resist in the past and failed, you believe that your willpower just isn&rsquo;t up to snuff. But the truth is that you have more power over your cravings than you think.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Take 5 before you give in to a craving</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Emotional eating tends to be automatic and virtually mindless. Before you even realize what you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;ve reached for a tub of ice cream and polished off half of it. But if you can take a moment to pause and reflect when you&rsquo;re hit with a craving, you give yourself the opportunity to make a different decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Can you put off eating for five minutes?</strong>&nbsp;Or just start with one minute. Don&rsquo;t tell yourself you&nbsp;<em>can&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;give in to the craving; remember, the forbidden is extremely tempting. Just tell yourself to wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>While you&rsquo;re waiting, check in with yourself.</strong>&nbsp;How are you feeling? What&rsquo;s going on emotionally? Even if you end up eating, you&rsquo;ll have a better understanding of why you did it. This can help you set yourself up for a different response next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Learn to accept your feelings&mdash;even the bad ones</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While it may seem that the core problem is that you&rsquo;re powerless over food, emotional eating actually stems from feeling powerless over your emotions. You don&rsquo;t feel capable of dealing with your feelings head on, so you avoid them with food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Allowing yourself to feel uncomfortable emotions can be scary. You may fear that, like Pandora&rsquo;s box, once you open the door you won&rsquo;t be able to shut it. But the truth is that when we don&rsquo;t obsess over or suppress our emotions, even the most painful and difficult feelings subside relatively quickly and lose their power to control our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">To do this you need to become mindful and learn how to stay connected to your moment-to-moment emotional experience. This can enable you to rein in stress and repair emotional problems that often trigger emotional eating. HelpGuide&rsquo;s free&nbsp;Emotional Intelligence Toolkit&nbsp;can show you how.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Indulge without overeating by savoring your food</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When you eat to feed your feelings, you tend to do so quickly, mindlessly consuming food on autopilot. You eat so fast you miss out on the different tastes and textures of your food&mdash;as well as your body&rsquo;s cues that you&rsquo;re full and no longer hungry. But by slowing down and savoring every bite, you&rsquo;ll not only enjoy your food more but you&rsquo;ll also be less likely to overeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Slowing down and savoring your food is an important aspect of mindful eating, the opposite of mindless, emotional eating. Try taking a few deep breaths before starting your food, putting your utensils down between bites, and really focusing on the experience of eating. Pay attention to the textures, shapes, colors and smells of your food.&nbsp;How does each mouthful taste? How does it make your body feel?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">By slowing down in this way, you&rsquo;ll find you appreciate each bite of food much more. You can even indulge in your favorite foods and feel full on much less. It takes time for the body&rsquo;s fullness signal to reach your brain, so taking a few moments to consider how you feel after each bite&mdash;hungry or satiated&mdash;can help you avoid overeating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Support yourself with healthy lifestyle habits</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When you&rsquo;re physically strong, relaxed, and well rested, you&rsquo;re better able to handle the curveballs that life inevitably throws your way. But when you&rsquo;re already exhausted and overwhelmed, any little hiccup has the potential to send you off the rails and straight toward the refrigerator. Exercise, sleep, and other healthy lifestyle habits will help you get through difficult times without emotional eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make daily exercise a priority.</strong>&nbsp;Physical activity does wonders for your mood&nbsp;and energy levels, and it&rsquo;s also a powerful stress reducer. And&nbsp;getting into the exercise habit&nbsp;is easier than you may think.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aim for 8 hours of sleep every night.</strong>&nbsp;When you don&rsquo;t&nbsp;get the sleep you need, your body craves sugary foods that will give you a quick energy boost. Getting plenty of rest will help with appetite control and reduce food cravings.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make time for relaxation.&nbsp;</strong>Give yourself permission to take at least 30 minutes every day to relax, decompress, and unwind. This is your time to take a break from your responsibilities and recharge your batteries.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Connect with others.</strong>&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t underestimate the importance of close relationships and social activities. Spending time with positive people who enhance your life will help protect you from the negative effects of stress.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n');

Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Self-management</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You&rsquo;re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Self-awareness</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Social awareness</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Relationship management</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Why is emotional intelligence so important?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As we know, it&rsquo;s not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life. You probably know people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially inept and unsuccessful at work or in their personal relationships. Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ) isn&rsquo;t enough on its own to achieve success in life. Yes, your IQ can help you get into college, but it&rsquo;s your EQ that will help you manage the stress and emotions when facing your final exams. IQ and EQ exist in tandem and are most effective when they build off one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Emotional intelligence affects:</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Your performance at school or work.</strong>&nbsp;High emotional intelligence can help you navigate the social complexities of the workplace, lead and motivate others, and excel in your career. In fact, when it comes to gauging important job candidates, many companies now rate emotional intelligence as important as technical ability and employ EQ testing before hiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Your physical health.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re unable to manage your emotions, you are probably not managing your stress either. This can lead to serious health problems. Uncontrolled stress raises blood pressure, suppresses the immune system, increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, contributes to infertility, and speeds up the aging process. The first step to improving emotional intelligence is to learn how to manage stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Your mental health.</strong>&nbsp;Uncontrolled emotions and stress can also impact your mental health, making you vulnerable to anxiety and depression. If you are unable to understand, get comfortable with, or manage your emotions, you&rsquo;ll also struggle to form strong relationships. This in turn can leave you feeling lonely and isolated and further exacerbate any mental health problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Your relationships.</strong>&nbsp;By understanding your emotions and how to control them, you&rsquo;re better able to express how you feel and understand how others are feeling. This allows you to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships, both at work and in your personal life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Your social intelligence.</strong>&nbsp;Being in tune with your emotions serves a social purpose, connecting you to other people and the world around you. Social intelligence enables you to recognize friend from foe, measure another person&rsquo;s interest in you, reduce stress, balance your nervous system through social communication, and feel loved and happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Building emotional intelligence: Four key skills to increasing your EQ</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The skills that make up emotional intelligence can be learned at any time. However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there is a difference between simply learning about EQ and applying that knowledge to your life. Just because you know you should do something doesn&rsquo;t mean you will&mdash;especially when you become overwhelmed by stress, which can override your best intentions. In order to permanently change behavior in ways that stand up under pressure, you need to learn how to overcome stress in the moment, and in your relationships, in order to remain emotionally aware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The key skills for building your EQ and improving your ability to manage emotions and connect with others are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Self-management</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Self-awareness</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Social awareness</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Relationship management</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Key skill 1: Self-management</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In order for you to engage your EQ, you must be able use your emotions to make constructive decisions about your behavior. When you become overly stressed, you can lose control of your emotions and the ability to act thoughtfully and appropriately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Think about a time when stress has overwhelmed you. Was it easy to think clearly or make a rational decision? Probably not. When you become overly stressed, your ability to both think clearly and accurately assess emotions&mdash;your own and other people&rsquo;s&mdash;becomes compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Emotions are important pieces of information that tell you about yourself and others, but in the face of stress that takes us out of our comfort zone, we can become overwhelmed and lose control of ourselves. With the ability to&nbsp;manage stress&nbsp;and stay emotionally present, you can learn to receive upsetting information without letting it override your thoughts and self-control. You&rsquo;ll be able to make choices that allow you to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Key skill 2: Self-awareness</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Managing stress is just the first step to building emotional intelligence. The science of&nbsp;attachment&nbsp;indicates that your current emotional experience is likely a reflection of your early life experience. Your ability to manage core feelings such as anger, sadness, fear, and joy often depends on the quality and consistency of your early life emotional experiences. If your primary caretaker as an infant understood and valued your emotions, it&rsquo;s likely your emotions have become valuable assets in adult life. But, if your emotional experiences as an infant were confusing, threatening or painful, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ve tried to distance yourself from your emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">But being able to connect to your emotions&mdash;having a moment-to-moment connection with your changing emotional experience&mdash;is the key to understanding how emotion influences your thoughts and actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Do you experience feelings that flow,</strong>&nbsp;encountering one emotion after another as your experiences change from moment to moment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Are your emotions accompanied by physical sensations that you experience</strong>&nbsp;in places like your stomach, throat, or chest?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Do you experience individual feelings and emotions,</strong>&nbsp;such as anger, sadness, fear, and joy, each of which is evident in subtle facial expressions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Can you experience intense feelings</strong>&nbsp;that are strong enough to capture both your attention and that of others?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Do you pay attention to your emotions?</strong>&nbsp;Do they factor into your decision making?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If any of these experiences are unfamiliar, you may have &ldquo;turned down&rdquo; or &ldquo;turned off&rdquo; your emotions. In order to build EQ&mdash;and become emotionally healthy&mdash;you must reconnect to your core emotions, accept them, and become comfortable with them. You can achieve this through the practice of mindfulness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Mindfulness</strong>&nbsp;is the practice of purposely focusing your attention on the present moment&mdash;and without judgment. The cultivation of mindfulness has roots in Buddhism, but most religions include some type of similar prayer or meditation technique.&nbsp;Mindfulness&nbsp;helps shift your preoccupation with thought toward an appreciation of the moment, your physical and emotional sensations, and brings a larger perspective on life. Mindfulness calms and focuses you, making you more self-aware in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Key skill 3: Social awareness</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Social awareness enables you to recognize and interpret the mainly nonverbal cues others are constantly using to communicate with you. These cues let you know how others are really feeling, how their emotional state is changing from moment to moment, and what&rsquo;s truly important to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When groups of people send out similar nonverbal cues, you&rsquo;re able to read and understand the power dynamics and shared emotional experiences of the group. In short, you&rsquo;re empathetic and socially comfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Mindfulness is an ally of emotional and social awareness</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">To build social awareness, you need to recognize the importance of mindfulness in the social process. After all, you can&rsquo;t pick up on subtle nonverbal cues when you&rsquo;re in your own head, thinking about other things, or simply zoning out on your phone. Social awareness requires your presence in the moment. While many of us pride ourselves on an ability to multitask, this means that you&rsquo;ll miss the subtle emotional shifts taking place in other people that help you fully understand them.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">You are actually more likely to further your social goals by setting other thoughts aside and focusing on the interaction itself.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Following the flow of another person&rsquo;s emotional responses is a give-and-take process that requires you to also pay attention to the changes in your own emotional experience.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Paying attention to others doesn&rsquo;t diminish your own self-awareness. By investing the time and effort to really pay attention to others, you&rsquo;ll actually gain insight into your own emotional state as well as your values and beliefs. For example, if you feel discomfort hearing others express certain views, you&rsquo;ll have learned something important about yourself.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Key skill 4: Relationship management</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Working well with others is a process that begins with emotional awareness and your ability to recognize and understand what other people are experiencing. Once emotional awareness is in play, you can effectively develop additional social/emotional skills that will make your relationships more effective, fruitful, and fulfilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Become aware of how effectively you use nonverbal communication.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s impossible to avoid sending&nbsp;nonverbal messages&nbsp;to others about what you think and feel. The many muscles in the face, especially those around the eyes, nose, mouth and forehead, help you to wordlessly convey your own emotions as well as read other peoples&rsquo; emotional intent. The emotional part of your brain is always on&mdash;and even if you ignore its messages&mdash;others won&rsquo;t. Recognizing the nonverbal messages that you send to others can play a huge part in improving your relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Use humor and play to relieve stress.</strong>&nbsp;Humor, laughter and play are natural antidotes to stress. They lessen your burdens and help you keep things in perspective.&nbsp;Laughte<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/laughter-is-the-best-medicine.htm">r</a>&nbsp;brings your nervous system into balance, reducing stress, calming you down, sharpening your mind and making you more empathic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Learn to see conflict as an opportunity to grow closer to others.</strong>&nbsp;Conflict and disagreements are inevitable in human relationships. Two people can&rsquo;t possibly have the same needs, opinions, and expectations at all times. However, that needn&rsquo;t be a bad thing.&nbsp;Resolving conflict&nbsp;in healthy, constructive ways can strengthen trust between people. When conflict isn&rsquo;t perceived as threatening or punishing, it fosters freedom, creativity, and safety in relationships.</p>\r\n'),

It also affects your ability to cope with stress, overcome challenges, build relationships, and recover from life&rsquo;s setbacks and hardships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Strong mental health isn&rsquo;t just the absence of mental health problems. Being mentally or emotionally healthy is much more than being free of depression, anxiety, or other psychological issues. Rather than the absence of mental illness, mental health refers to the presence of positive characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">People who are mentally healthy have:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">A sense of contentment.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The ability to deal with stress and bounce back from adversity.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">A sense of meaning and purpose, in both their activities and their relationships.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The flexibility to learn new skills and adapt to change.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">A balance between work and play, rest and activity, etc.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The ability to build and maintain fulfilling relationships.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Self-confidence and high self-esteem.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">How to boost your mental health&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Anyone can suffer from mental or emotional health problems&mdash;and over a lifetime most of us will. This year alone, about one in five of us will suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder. Yet, despite how common mental health problems are, many of us make no effort to improve our situation. We ignore the emotional messages that tell us something is wrong and try toughing it out by distracting ourselves or self-medicating with alcohol, drugs, or self-destructive behaviors. We bottle up our problems in the hope that others won&rsquo;t notice. We hope that our situation will eventually improve on its own. Or we simply give up&mdash;telling ourselves this is &ldquo;just the way we are.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The good news is: you don&rsquo;t have to feel bad. There are practices you can adopt to elevate your mood, become more resilient, and enjoy life more. But just as it requires effort to build and maintain physical health, so it is with mental health. We have to work harder these days to ensure strong mental health, simply because there are so many ways that life takes a toll on our emotional well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Make social connection a priority&mdash;especially face-to-face</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">No matter how much time you devote to improving your mental and emotional health, you will still need the company of others to feel and function at your best. Humans are social creatures with emotional needs for relationships and positive connections to others. We&rsquo;re not meant to survive, let alone thrive, in isolation. Our social brains crave companionship&mdash;even when experience has made us shy and distrustful of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Why is face-to-face connection so important?</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Phone calls and social networks have their place, but nothing can beat the stress-busting, mood-boosting power of quality face-to-face time with other people. The key is to interact with someone who is a &ldquo;good listener&rdquo;&mdash;someone you can regularly talk to in person, who will listen to you without their own conceptions of how you should think or feel. A good listener will listen to the feelings behind your words, and won&rsquo;t interrupt, judge, or criticize you. Reaching out is not a sign of weakness and it won&rsquo;t make you a burden to others. Most people are flattered if you trust them enough to confide in them. If you don&rsquo;t feel that you have anyone to turn to, there are good ways to&nbsp;build new friendships&nbsp;and improve your support network. In the meantime, there is still a great benefit to interacting face-to-face with acquaintances or people you encounter during the day, such as neighbors, people in the checkout line or on the bus, or the person serving you your morning coffee. Make eye contact and exchange a smile, a friendly greeting, or small talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Staying active is as good for the brain as it is for the body</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The mind and the body are intrinsically linked. When you improve your physical health, you&rsquo;ll automatically experience greater mental and emotional well-being. Physical activity also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals that lift your mood and provide added energy. Regular exercise or activity can have a major impact on mental and emotional health problems, relieve stress, improve memory, and help you to sleep better.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">But what if I hate to exercise?</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Well, you&rsquo;re not alone. Pounding weights in a gym or jogging on a treadmill isn&rsquo;t everyone&rsquo;s idea of a great time. But you&nbsp;don&rsquo;t have to be a fitness fanatic&nbsp;to reap the benefits of being more active. Take a walk at lunchtime through a park, walk laps in an air-conditioned mall while window shopping, throw a Frisbee with a dog, dance to your favorite music, play activity-based video games with your kids, cycle or walk to an appointment rather than drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You don&rsquo;t have to exercise until you&rsquo;re soaked in sweat or every muscle aches. Even modest amounts of physical activity can make a big difference to your mental and emotional health&mdash;and it&rsquo;s something you can engage in&nbsp;<strong>right now</strong>&nbsp;to boost your energy and outlook and help you regain a sense of control.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="color:#e74c3c">Learn how to keep your stress levels in check</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Stress takes a heavy toll on mental and emotional health, so it&rsquo;s important to keep it under control. While not all stressors can be avoided, stress management strategies can help you brings things back into balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Talk to a friendly face</strong>. Face-to-face social interaction with someone who cares about you is the most effective way to calm your nervous system and relieve stress. Interacting with another person can quickly put the brakes on damaging stress responses like &ldquo;fight-or-flight.&rdquo; It also releases stress-busting hormones, so you&rsquo;ll feel better even if you&rsquo;re unable to alter the stressful situation itself..</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make leisure time a priority</strong>. Partake in your favorite activities for no reason other than that they make you feel good. Go to a funny movie, take a walk on the beach, listen to music, read a good book, or talk to a friend. Doing things just because they are fun is no indulgence. Play is an emotional and mental health necessity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make time for contemplation and appreciation</strong>. Think about the things you&rsquo;re grateful for. Mediate, pray, enjoy the sunset, or simply take a moment to pay attention to what is good, positive, and beautiful as you go about your day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Take up a relaxation practice</strong>. While sensory input can relieve stress in the moment,&nbsp;relaxation techniques&nbsp;can help reduce your overall levels of stress&mdash;although they&rsquo;re likely to take more time to learn effectively. Yoga, mindfulness meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation can put the brakes on stress and bring your mind and body back into a state of balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Eat a brain-healthy diet to support strong mental health</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Unless you&rsquo;ve tried to change your diet in the past, you may not be aware how much of what you eat&mdash;and don&rsquo;t eat&mdash;affects the way you think and feel. An unhealthy diet can take a toll on your brain and mood, disrupt your sleep, sap your energy, and weaken your immune system. Conversely, switching to a<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-eating/healthy-eating.htm">&nbsp;</a>wholesome diet, low in sugar and rich in healthy fats, can give you more energy, improve your sleep and mood, and help you to look and feel your best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">People respond slightly differently to certain foods, depending on genetics and other health factors, so experiment with how the food you include in&mdash;or cut from&mdash;your diet changes the way you feel. The best place to start is by cutting out the &ldquo;bad fats&rdquo; that can damage your mood and outlook, and replace them with &ldquo;good fats&rdquo; that support brain-health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Foods that adversely affect mood</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Caffeine.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Alcohol.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Trans fats or anything with &ldquo;partially hydrogenated&rdquo; oil.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Foods with high levels of chemical preservatives or hormones.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Sugary snacks.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Refined carbs (such as white rice or white flour).</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fried food.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Foods that boost mood</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fatty fish rich in Omega-3s such as salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Nuts such as walnuts, almonds, cashews, peanuts.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Avocados.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Flaxseed.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Leafy greens such as spinach, Brussel&rsquo;s sprouts.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fresh fruit such as blueberries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Don&rsquo;t skimp on sleep&mdash;it matters more than you think</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you lead a busy life, cutting back on sleep may seem like a smart move. But when it comes to your mental health, getting enough sleep is a necessity, not a luxury. Skipping even a few hours here and there can take a toll on your mood, energy, mental sharpness, and ability to handle stress. And over the long-term, chronic sleep loss can wreak havoc on your health and outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While adults should aim for seven to nine hours of&nbsp;quality sleep&nbsp;each night, it&rsquo;s often unrealistic to expect sleep to come the moment you lay down and close your eyes. Your brain needs time to unwind at the end of the day. That means taking a break from the stimulation of screens&mdash;TV, phone, tablet, computer&mdash;in the two hours before bedtime, putting aside work, and postponing arguments, worrying, or brainstorming until the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Find purpose and meaning in life</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Everyone derives meaning and purpose in different ways that involve benefitting others, as well as yourself. You may think of it as a way to feel needed, feel good about yourself, a purpose that drives you on, or simply a reason to get out of bed in the morning. In biological terms, finding meaning and purpose is essential to brain health as it can help generate new cells and create new neural pathways in the brain. It can also strengthen your immune system, alleviate pain, relieve stress, and keep you motivated to pursue the other steps to improve mental and emotional health. However you derive meaning and purpose in life, it&rsquo;s important to do it every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">What gives you meaning and purpose?</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Engaging work that provides meaning to yourself and others.</strong>&nbsp;Partake in activities that challenge your creativity and make you feel productive, whether or not you get paid for them. Some ideas are gardening, drawing, writing, playing an instrument, or building something in your workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Relationships.</strong>&nbsp;Spending quality time where you give of yourself to people who matter to you, whether they&rsquo;re friends, grandkids, or elderly relatives, can support both your health and theirs, while also providing a sense of purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Volunteering.</strong>&nbsp;Just as we&rsquo;re hard-wired to be social, we&rsquo;re also hard-wired to give to others. The meaning and purpose derived from helping others or the community can enrich and expand your life&mdash;and make you happier. There&rsquo;s no limit to the individual and group&nbsp;volunteer&nbsp;opportunities you can explore. Schools, churches, nonprofits, and charitable organizations of all sorts depend on volunteers for their survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Caregiving.</strong>&nbsp;Taking care of an aging parent, a handicapped spouse, or a child with a physical or mental illness is an act of kindness, love, and loyalty&mdash;and can be as rewarding and meaningful as it is challenging.</p>\r\n'),

There are many externals our society teaches us to chase: success, wealth, fame, power, good looks, romantic love. But are they really the keys to happiness?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The research says no, at least when it comes to long-term happiness. A prestigious award, a big raise, an exciting new relationship, a fancy new car, losing weight, these things can make us feel great at first, but the thrill doesn&rsquo;t last very long. Human beings are quick to adapt to new circumstances&mdash;a quality that has helped us survive and thrive. But it also means that the positive things that initially make us happier soon become our new normal and we return to our old happiness baseline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">However, researchers in the field of positive psychology have found that you can genuinely increase your happiness and overall satisfaction with life&mdash;and it doesn&rsquo;t require a winning lottery ticket or some other drastic change of circumstances. What it takes is an inner change of perspective and attitude. And that&rsquo;s truly good news, because it&rsquo;s something anyone can do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 1: Train your brain to be more positive</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Our brains are wired to notice and remember the things that are wrong. It&rsquo;s a survival mechanism that helped keep our cave-dwelling ancestors safe in a world where there were many physical threats. But in today&rsquo;s comparatively safe world, this biological predisposition to focus on the negative contributes to stress and unhappiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While we can&rsquo;t change our nature, we can train our brains to be more positive. This doesn&rsquo;t mean putting on a smiley face and whistling a happy tune no matter what&rsquo;s going on. You don&rsquo;t have to ignore reality or pretend things are wonderful even when they&rsquo;re not. But just as dwelling on negative things fuels unhappiness, choosing to notice, appreciate, and anticipate goodness is a powerful happiness booster.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Express gratitude</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Teaching yourself to become more grateful can make a huge difference in your overall happiness. The research shows that gratitude helps you experience more positive emotions, decrease depression, feel better about yourself, improve your relationships, and strengthen your immune system. A recent study revealed that gratitude even makes you smarter about how you spend your money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">There are a number of simple exercises you can practice to increase and cultivate an attitude of gratitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Give sincere thanks to others.</strong>&nbsp;When someone goes above and beyond or does something to make your day easier, be quick to verbalize your thanks and appreciation. Not only will it make the person feel good, it will give you a happiness lift, too. It&rsquo;s an instant reward to see how expressing gratitude makes a positive difference in someone else&rsquo;s day. It makes you realize that we&rsquo;re all connected and that what you do matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Count your blessings.</strong>&nbsp;Make it a habit to regularly reflect on the things you have to be thankful for. Bring to mind all the good people, experiences, and things in your life, both now and in the past. Focus on the blessings both big and small, from the people who love you, to the roof over your head and the food on your table. You will soon see it&rsquo;s a pretty long list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Find the positive in a negative event from your past.</strong>&nbsp;Even the most painful circumstances can teach us positive lessons. Reevaluate a negative event from your past with an eye for what you learned or how you became stronger, wiser, or more compassionate. When you can find meaning in even the bad things you&rsquo;ve experienced, you will be happier and more grateful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 2: Nurture and enjoy your relationships</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Relationships are one of the biggest sources of happiness in our lives. Studies that look at happy people bear this out. The happier the person, the more likely that he or she has a large, supportive circle of family and friends, a fulfilling marriage, and a thriving social life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">That&rsquo;s why nurturing your relationships is one of the best emotional investments you can make. If you make an effort to cultivate and build your connections with others, you will soon reap the rewards of more positive emotions. And as you become happier, you will attract more people and higher-quality relationships, leading to even greater positivity and enjoyment. It&rsquo;s the happiness gift that keeps on giving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make a conscious effort to stay connected.</strong>&nbsp;In our busy society, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in our responsibilities and neglect our relationships. But losing touch with friends is one of the most common end-of-life regrets. Don&rsquo;t let it happen to you. Make an effort to stay connected to the people who make your life brighter. Take the time to call, write, or see each other in person. You&rsquo;ll be happier for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Invest in quality time with the people you care about.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not just the time spent with friends and family that matters; it&rsquo;s how you spend it. Mindlessly vegging out together in front of the TV isn&rsquo;t going to make you closer. People who are in happy relationships talk a lot. They share what&rsquo;s going on in their lives and how they feel. Follow their example and carve out time to talk and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Seek out happy people.</strong>&nbsp;Research shows that happiness is contagious. You can literally catch a good mood (you can also catch a bad mood, but thankfully, sadness is less contagious than happiness). So, make an effort to seek out and spend time with happy people. Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be feeling the happiness, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 3: Live in the moment and savor life&rsquo;s pleasures</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Think about a time when you were depressed or anxious. Chances are, you were either dwelling on something negative from the past or worrying about something in the future. In contrast, when you focus on the present moment, you are much more likely to feel centered, happy, and at peace. You&rsquo;re also much more likely to notice the good things that are happening, rather than letting them pass by unappreciated or unobserved. So how do you start to live more in the moment and savor the good things life has to offer?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Meditate</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Mindfulness meditation is a powerful technique for learning to live in and enjoy the moment. And you don&rsquo;t have to be religious or even spiritual to reap its benefits. No pan flutes, chanting, or yoga pants required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Simply speaking, meditation is exercise for your brain. When practiced regularly, meditation appears to decrease activity in the areas of the brain associated with negative thoughts, anxiety, and depression. At the same time, it increases activity in the areas associated with joy, contentment, and peace. It also strengthens areas of the brain in charge of managing emotions and controlling attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Notice and savor small pleasures</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you adopt a mindfulness meditation practice, you will automatically begin to notice and savor life&rsquo;s pleasures more. But there are other things you can do to increase your awareness and enjoyment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Adopt enjoyable daily rituals.</strong>&nbsp;Build moments of enjoyment into your day with pleasurable rituals. These can be very simple things like lingering over a cup of coffee in the morning, taking a short stroll in the sunshine during your lunch hour, or playing with your dog when you get home. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do, as long as you enjoy and appreciate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Minimize multi-tasking.</strong>&nbsp;Savoring requires your full attention, which is impossible when you&rsquo;re trying to do multiple things. For example, if you&rsquo;re eating a delicious meal while distractedly surfing the Internet, you&rsquo;re not going to get as much pleasure out of the food as you could have. Focus on one thing at a time in order to truly maximize your enjoyment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Replay happy memories.</strong>&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to limit your savoring to things that are happening now. Remembering and reminiscing about happy memories and experiences from your past leads to more positive emotions in the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 4: Focus on helping others and living with meaning</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">There is something truly fulfilling in helping others and feeling like your actions are making a difference for the better in the world. That&rsquo;s why people who assist those in need and give back to others and their communities tend to be happier. In addition, they also tend to have higher self-esteem and general psychological well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Here are some ways to live a more altruistic, meaningful life:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Volunteer.</strong>&nbsp;Happiness is just one of the many&nbsp;benefits of volunteering. You&rsquo;ll get the most out of the experience by volunteering for an organization that you believe in and that allows you to contribute in a meaningful way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Practice kindness.&nbsp;</strong>Look for ways to be more kind, compassionate, and giving in your daily life. This can be something as small as brightening a stranger&rsquo;s day with a smile or going out of your way to do a favor for a friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Play to your strengths.</strong>&nbsp;The happiest people know what their unique strengths are and build their lives around activities that allow them to use those strengths for the greater good. There are many different kinds of strengths, including kindness, curiosity, honesty, creativity, love of learning, perseverance, loyalty, optimism, and humor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Go for the flow.</strong>&nbsp;Research shows that flow, a state of complete immersion and engagement in an activity, is closely associated with happiness. Flow happens when you&rsquo;re actively engaged in something that is intrinsically rewarding and challenging yet still attainable. Anything that completely captivates you and engages your full attention can be a flow activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#e74c3c">Tip 5: Take better care of your health</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You can be happy even when you&rsquo;re suffering from illness or bad health, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should ignore the aspects of your health that are in your control. Exercise and sleep are particularly important when it comes to happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Make exercise a regular habit</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Exercise isn&rsquo;t just good for the body. It also&nbsp;has a powerful effect on mental well-being. People who exercise regularly are happier across the board. Plus, they&rsquo;re also less stressed, angry, anxious, and depressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what kind of exercise you do, so long as you do it regularly. For best results, aim for an hour of exercise at least five days a week. If you find something you enjoy, you&rsquo;ll be more likely to stick to it. So don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re limited to going to the gym or lacing up jogging shoes. Find something that suits your lifestyle and preferences. It could be taking a dance class, shooting hoops, walking in nature, joining a community sports league, playing tennis, running with your dog, swimming laps at the pool, hiking, biking, or doing yoga in the park. If you&rsquo;re having trouble thinking of activities you enjoy, think back to when you were a kid. What sports or games did you like to play?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Get the sleep you need</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Getting&nbsp;quality sleep&nbsp;every night directly affects your happiness, vitality, and emotional stability during the day. When you&rsquo;re sleep deprived, you&rsquo;re much more susceptible to stress. It&rsquo;s harder to be productive, think creatively, and make wise decisions. How much sleep do you need? According to sleep scientists, the average person needs at least 7.5 &ndash; 9 hours each night.</p>\r\n');

However, when it comes to being active you should aim to move as much as you can every day &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s with brisk walking, jogging, swimming, gardening or putting your all into the housework!</p>\r\n', 'Exercise and Fitness'),
(3, ' How long do I need to work out for?', '<p style="text-align:justify">This depends on your fitness levels, what type of training you&rsquo;re doing and what intensity you&rsquo;re training at. Just remember, something is always better than nothing. If you only have 30 minutes, try to fit in a&nbsp;quick HIIT&nbsp;(High Intensity Interval Training) workout or go for a run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;re doing a strength workout, set aside more time for warming up and mobilising to help avoid injury and make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough rest between sets. Either way, you definitely don&rsquo;t need to be slogging it out for hours!</p>\r\n', 'Exercise and Fitness'),
(4, 'Do I need to vary my workout to see results?', '<p style="text-align:justify">If you want to see real change in your body you need to mix up your routine. The body quickly adapts to exercise and if you continue to do the same workout or use the same weights, it will plateau as it stops responding to the training stimulus. Increase frequency, intensity or the type of training as often as you can.</p>\r\n', 'Exercise and Fitness'),
(5, 'What type of training do I need to do to lose weight?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Generally, cardio training such as swimming or running will burn the most calories per session. Weight training will help you burn more calories over the course of the day &ndash; muscle burns more calories at rest than other tissues, including fat, and therefore speeds up your resting metabolism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Researchers have found that HIIT exercise burns 25%-30% more calories than a steady-state exercise session such as a run. Therefore, combining cardio, weights and HIIT-specific training alongside a diet that will leave you in a calorie deficit is the most effective route to weight loss.</p>\r\n', 'Exercise and Fitness'),
(6, 'What type of training do I need to get stronger?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Strength can mean different&nbsp;to different people. For some it can mean being able to do one pull up, for others it might be reaching a deadlift PB, which is why it is important to train for your goals. In order to gain strength in a targeted area, you need to gradually increase your volume (times per week and reps) and the intensity of those sessions. Try setting yourself realistic targets each week so that you have something specific to aim for.</p>\r\n', 'Exercise and Fitness'),
(7, 'How often do I need to rest?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Ensure you have at least one rest day per week to allow your body to regenerate and repair, so you can come back stronger.</p>\r\n', 'Exercise and Fitness'),
(8, 'Should I go gluten-free?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Unless you suffer from celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no reason to be on a gluten-free diet. Some symptoms of celiac disease or gluten sensitivity are diarrhea, unexpected weight loss, vomiting, anemia, abdominal pain and distention, fatigue, joint pain, foggy mind, and tingling of the extremities. If you are continually suffering from some or all of these symptoms, consult your doctor to get a proper diagnosis. Once celiac disease has been ruled out, you can try the gluten-free diet for a while and see if you feel better. You may. Or you may not. A gluten-free diet will not make you lose weight and is not necessarily healthier. A gluten free cookie is still a cookie.</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(9, 'Is a vegetarian diet best?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Yes, no, maybe, most likely! Long story short, processed meats are proven carcinogens and people who are vegetarians tend to eat more fruit and vegetables, which we all need and which most of us lack. But a Pepsi and French fries diet is not a good diet even if vegetarian.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(10, 'Is sugar (or salt or fat) the biggest problem in our diets?', '<p style="text-align:justify">No single nutrient or ingredient is the cause of poor diets. We live in an environment where highly palatable and cheap food is available everywhere. Pizza, chips, pastries and soda are &shy;dietary staples, and the average American gets almost 60 percent of their daily calories from such ultra-processed foods. What&rsquo;s most problematic is eating too much of those ultra-processed foods and not enough whole foods (such as vegetables, fish and nuts) over a long period of time.</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(11, 'Do microwaves cause cancer?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Many people have asked me about the safety of using these appliances to warm up last night&rsquo;s lasagna. They worry when they hear the word &shy;&ldquo;radiation.&rdquo; Although radiation may be linked to damaged cells and an increased cancer risk when it&rsquo;s high frequency and there&rsquo;s prolonged exposure (think gamma rays and some ultraviolet radiation), microwaves use &shy;low-frequency radiation for short periods. Microwaves only operate when the oven is on and the door is shut &mdash; so they are not constantly emitting radiation. Well-functioning microwaves are deemed safe by the World Health Organization and the World Cancer Research Fund, as long as the door closes &shy;properly and the microwave has no dents or leaks.</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(12, ' Do I need to drink eight glasses of water daily?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Drinking water is vital because we lose fluid every day through sweating, urinating and breathing. But how can it be possible that each one of us &mdash; regardless of age, gender, size, activity level and diet &mdash; requires eight glasses per day? The answer: It&rsquo;s not. That number comes from a 1945 U.S. Food and Nutrition Board recommendation, which was not based on research. And it didn&rsquo;t recommend drinking only water for hydration; it noted that fluid can come from other beverages and food, too. So, there&rsquo;s no scientific basis for the &ldquo;eight glasses&rdquo; number. In most cases, thirst is your best &shy;indicator that you need a drink. If that sense is compromised, keep beverages visible so you remember to sip throughout the day. &shy;Exactly how much to drink is not a static number for everyone.</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(13, 'Is food labeled "organic" more nutritious?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Organic refers to a method of farming, but it&rsquo;s not a health claim. An organic logo does not tell you anything about the calories, fat, salt, sugar or vitamin content of food. A cake made with organic white flour, organic sugar and organic butter is still cake &mdash; it&rsquo;s not suddenly &ldquo;healthy cake&rdquo; because the ingredients were grown using organic farming methods. Nutritious foods &mdash; whether conventionally or &shy;organically grown &mdash; are those that provide the body with fiber, vitamins, minerals, protein and other key nutrients.</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(14, 'People with a body mass index (BMI) value of what or more are considered obese?', '<p style="text-align:justify">BMI values between 18.5 and 24.9 are considered to be a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; weight. BMI values between 25 and 29.9 are considered &ldquo;overweight,&rdquo; while BMI values of 30 and above are considered &ldquo;obese.&rdquo; BMIs above 25 are unhealthy and have been shown to increase the risk of certain chronic diseases. BMIs under 18.5 are considered &ldquo;underweight.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(15, 'From which foods can we get carbohydrates?', '<p style="text-align:justify">Milk products and fruits, whole grain breads and cereals, table sugar, starchy vegetables, and legumes. Carbohydrates are called &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;complex,&quot; depending on how fast your body digests and absorbs the sugar. You get simple carbohydrates from fruits, milk products, and table sugar. Complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and cereals, starchy vegetables, and legumes. Complex carbohydrates and some simple carbohydrates provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Products made with refined sugar provide little nutrition. It is wise to limit these products.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(16, 'A good rule of thumb is to drink 10-12 glasses of water per day. True or False?', '<p style="text-align:justify">False. There is no evidence to show that drinking 10-12 glasses of water is necessary. Generally, nutritionists recommend we follow the &ldquo;8x8&rdquo; rule, which is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. Drinking more water does indeed boost metabolism - especially if your glass is icy cold. Your body must work to warm the water up, burning a few extra calories in the process. As for other benefits of water, 85% of your brain tissue is water, which means that if you&#39;re dehydrated, both your body and your mind will be stressed.</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(17, 'Are low carb diets safe?', '<p style="text-align:justify">No. And they don&rsquo;t work because you can&rsquo;t stay on them forever (who would want to never eat apples/strawberries/bread ever again?) Low carb diets make you gain weight in the long run. I have many clients post keto in my office who gained all the weight back. More long term studies need to be conducted to say that they are safe. Apples, brown rice and chickpeas are not the reasons why so many people are having weight issues. Donuts and litre-sized Pepsi are. Besides, eating so much animal protein is really unhealthy in the long run (heart disease, cancer, strokes etc.) and unsustainable. &nbsp;We can&rsquo;t keep doing this to our planet!</p>\r\n', 'Healthy Eating'),
(18, 'Is vegetarian (or keto or .â€‰.â€‰. ) the best way to eat?', '<p style="text-align:justify">In any given class, the subject may be &ldquo;keto&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Mediterranean diet&rdquo; or &ldquo;vegetarian,&rdquo; and the answer is always the same: There&rsquo;s not one best way to eat. We are all different, and it would be impossible to choose one plan that would be right for everyone. The best plan for you is the one that meets your medical and nutritional needs, while also &shy;being affordable, accessible, &shy;enjoyable and something you can stick with for the long term.

(1, 'Balanced Diet Chart', '<p style="text-align:justify">While creating a diet chart, it is important to make sure it is balanced, in order to ensure that you receive all the required nutrients. Include the following nutrients in your diet plan:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1. Carbohydrates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Carbs are the body&rsquo;s main source of energy and should make up half of your daily calorie requirement. However, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right type of carbs. Simple carbs, such as bread, biscuit, white rice and wheat flour, contain too much sugar and are bad for you. Instead, opt for complex carbs that are high in fiber&nbsp;and packed with nutrients as compared to simple carbs. Fiber-rich complex carbs are slow to digest, leave you feeling full for longer, and are therefore the best option for weight control. Brown rice, millets such as ragi and oats are all good complex carb choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Proteins</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Most Indians fail to meet their daily protein requirement. This is troublesome, as proteins are essential to help&nbsp;paper writer&nbsp;the body build and repair tissue, muscles, cartilage and skin, as well as pump blood. A high protein diet can also help you lose weight, as it helps build muscle &ndash; which burns more calories than fat.About 30% of your diet should consist of protein in the form of whole&nbsp;<em>dals, paneer, chana</em>, milk, leafy greens, eggs, white meat or sprouts. Having one helping of protein with every meal is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. Fats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A food group that has acquired a bad reputation, fats are essential for the body as they synthesize hormones, store vitamins and provide energy. Experts suggest one-fifth or 20% of your diet comprise of healthy fats &ndash; polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and Omega-3 fatty acids. Using a combination of oils for different meals &ndash; including olive oil, rice bran oil, mustard oil, soya bean, sesame, sunflower and groundnut oil &ndash; along with restricted quantities of butter and ghee is the most optimal way to consume fats. Avoid trans fats &ndash; that are found in fried snacks, completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>4. Vitamins and minerals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Vitamin A, E, B12, D, calcium and iron are essential for the body as they support metabolism, nerve and muscle function, bone maintenance, and cell production. Primarily derived from plants, meat and fish, minerals can be found in nuts, oilseeds, fruits and green leafy vegetables. <br>\r\nExperts recommend consuming 100 grams of greens and 100 grams of fruits everyday.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>5. Meal Swaps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">One of the easiest ways to eat healthy is to swap out the unhealthy foods in your diet with healthier alternatives. For example, fulfil your cravings for a snack to munch on with air popped popcorn instead of relying on potato chips. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Along with a balanced diet plan, these habits will help you stay healthy</strong></p><p><strong>1.\r\nOpt for 5-6 meals a day:</strong> Instead of three large meals, try having three modest meals and a few snack breaks through the day in controlled portions. Spacing your meals across regular intervals prevents acidity and bloating, and also keeps hunger pangs at bay. Quit your junk food habit by making healthier snack choices.</p><p><strong>2.\r\nHave an early dinner:</strong> Indians eat dinner later than the other societies across the world. Metabolism slows down at night, so a late dinner can lead to weight gain. Experts recommend you eat your last meal of the day by 8 pm.</p><p><strong>3.\r\nDrink a lot of water:</strong> How does drinking more water help you lose weight? For starters, it’s zero calories. Also, drinking a glass of water can help curb hunger pangs. Have six to eight glasses of water daily to lose weight. You can also find a list of drinks that will help you lose weight here.</p><p><strong>4.\r\nEat a lot of fiber:</strong> A person needs at least 15 gm of fiber every day, as it aids digestion and heart health. Oats, lentils, flax seeds, apples and broccoli are some great sources of fiber.</p><p>\r\nYou don’t have to ditch your regular food habits or make massive changes to your diet, you just need the best balanced Indian diet plan to get fit!</p>\r\n', 'uploads/m1.jpg', 1),

(3, '5 Keto Diet Tips for Beginners', '<p style="text-align:justify">While following a keto diet, one must take special care in certain cases. The following tips can help you follow the diet a lot better:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1. Drink Plenty of Water</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Staying hydrated is important at all times, but it is much more so in the case of a ketogenic diet. This is because the body releases more water from the body when the carb intake is a lot lower. Ideally, one should drink more water on days where they are likely to sweat more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Decrease Stress</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The stress hormone cortisol ends up elevating the body&rsquo;s blood sugar levels. Thus, this prevents the body from burning fat for energy due to the presence of excess sugar in it. Chronic stress can, therefore, severely hinder the body&rsquo;s ability to enter ketosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. Prioritise Sleep</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Less sleep plays a major role in higher stress levels. As discussed earlier, this can prevent your body from being able to burn fat. Maintaining a proper schedule can help improve one&rsquo;s quality of sleep. This, in turn, helps reduce stress and thus, makes the keto diet effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It is ideal to get about 8-9 hours of sleep every night. Plenty of studies have found that sleeping for fewer hours can hurt one&rsquo;s weight loss attempts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>4. Increase Salt Intake</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While we have always been taught to reduce our sodium consumption, this is necessary only in the case of high-carb diets. High-carb diets have naturally higher levels of insulin, leading to the kidney retaining sodium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When you reduce your carb intake as you do with a keto diet, insulin levels are a lot lower, and the body excretes a lot more salt. Therefore, you can increase your salt consumption by 3 to 5 g while in ketosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>5. Exercise Frequently</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While on a keto diet, a regular exercise schedule can help boost ketone levels, and transition into a low-carb, high-fat diet a lot faster. Getting rid of any glucose present in the body is key to the body getting into ketosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While exercising, the body uses different types of energy for fuel including carbs, amino acids and fats. Frequent exercises help the body get rid of its glycogen stores quicker.</p>\r\n', 'uploads/Drink-Water.jpg', 4),
(4, '5 Foods to Eat on a Ketogenic Diet', '<p>The Keto diet has several food requirements that must be met. Keto foods are normally low on carbs and high in fat. Here&rsquo;s a list of foods that one can consume while on a keto diet:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.Eggs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A single large egg contains less than one gram of carbohydrates and less than 6 grams of protein. This makes them an ideal food for the ketogenic diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eggs are also known to make an individual feel full while keeping their blood sugar levels stable. This leads to a lower calorie intake for almost 24 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eggs are ideal for a Keto Diet&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Cheese</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considered both nutritious and delicious, cheese is generally low in carbs and rich in fat. Thus, they are a great fit for a ketogenic diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although rich in saturated fat, cheese hasn&rsquo;t been known to increase the risk of heart disease. On the contrary, some studies claim that this dairy product can in fact reduce these risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Low-carb Vegetables</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-starchy vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms and lettuce, are low in calories and carbs but they are rich in several nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. Vegetables contain fiber, that your body will not digest, unlike carbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antioxidants present in these vegetables help protect the body against free radicals, or unstable molecules that cause cell damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.Seafood</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although rich in B vitamins, selenium and potassium, salmon and other fish are almost carb-free. This makes them extremely keto-friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The carb content varies across the various types of shellfish, however. You can always choose the low-carb variants to include in your keto diet. Two servings of seafood a week would be of great help to any individual on a keto diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Meat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meat and poultry are considered the staple food of the keto diet since they contain no carbs and are rich in B vitamins and several minerals. They are also a great source of high-quality protein, helping preserve muscle mass in the absence of carbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is ideal to choose grass-fed animals for meat since they consume more omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants than grain-fed animals.</p>\r\n', 'uploads/Eggs.jpg', 4),
(5, 'Keto Benefits', '<p style="text-align:justify">These low-carb diets do have their own advantages, nonetheless. Here are 7 health benefits of the keto diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1.May Lower Blood Pressure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As a condition, hypertension or high blood pressure levels is a significant risk factor for many heart diseases like heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. Reducing your carb intake can lower blood sugar levels, and thus, help prevent these diseases.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Weight Loss</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">An effective way to lose weight would be to simply cut down on your carb intake. Studies have shown that low-carb diets work better than low-fat diets when it comes to weight loss. This is in spite of the low-fat diets actively restricting calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Low-carb diets help get rid of excess water from the body. This lowers insulin levels, leading to rapid weight loss in the first couple of weeks. Studies comparing low-carb and low-fat diets have found that the former can help one lose 2-3 times the weight as the latter, without the individual being hungry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">However, one&nbsp;study&nbsp;found that the diet is particularly effective only for 6 months. After this, it works like any other weight loss diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. Improved Heart Health</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A keto diet plan can prove to be very efficient in improving one&rsquo;s heart health. Eating more fat helps improve the HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein), or good cholesterol, levels in the body. Low-carb diets, like the keto diet, have a lot of fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>4. May Improve Brain Function</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While more research is needed to confirm this, some studies do suggest that ketogenic diets do offer neuroprotective benefits. These include helping treat or prevent conditions like Parkinson&rsquo;s, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and certain sleep disorders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">One particular&nbsp;study&nbsp;has also indicated that children following a keto diet exhibit improved cognitive thinking and alertness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>5. Reduced Blood Sugar Levels</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Low-carb diets have been known to be particularly useful for those with diabetes or high blood sugar levels. Studies have shown that reducing your carb intake can lower both blood sugar and insulin levels drastically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Some people with diabetes that begin a low-carb diet are able to reduce their insulin dosage by 50% almost immediately. However, for those that take blood sugar medication, it is ideal to consult your doctor before making changes to your carb intake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>6.Reduced Appetite</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">One of the main side effects of following a diet is hunger cravings. While this may lead to a lot of people giving up on their diets, a keto diet results in the reduction of one&rsquo;s appetite. Studies have shown that this happens due to the cutting down of carbs, and the increased protein and fat intake. This eventually leads to a lower calorie intake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>7. Reduced Belly Fat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Two kinds of fat found in the human body are subcutaneous fat, that is found under the skin, and visceral fat, which accumulates in the abdominal cavity. Excess visceral fat can result in inflammation and insulin resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Low-carb diets can play a crucial role in reducing this belly fat.

One of the main reasons for this is the side effects that people on these diets experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1. Keto Flu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">At the start of ketosis, one may experience a range of negative symptoms. Since these symptoms resemble those of flu, the condition is called keto flu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In case of a keto flu, one may experience symptoms like headache, fatigue, lack of sleep, hunger, and nausea. These symptoms may last a few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Cramping of Leg Muscles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">There&rsquo;s a possibility of suffering from leg cramps in ketosis. These cramps are usually associated with dehydration and a loss of minerals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Glycogen binds water and this gets flushed out of the body when one&rsquo;s carb intake is reduced. This is also why people lose weight rapidly in the first week of the diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. Digestive Problems</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The reduced fiber intake leads to several digestive problems. People on ketogenic diets may suffer from constipation or diarrhea. Drastic changes to the diet in order to get into ketosis can also cause one to experience digestive trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>4. Elevated Heart Rate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Another possible side effect of ketosis is increased heart rate. Dehydration and low salt intake cause the heart rate to rise. If it doesn&rsquo;t normalize, you may need to increase your carbohydrate consumption.</p>\r\n', 'uploads/keto-side-effects-illustration.jpg', 4),
(8, 'Diabetic Diet Food List', '<p style="text-align:justify">Certain foods help lower blood sugar levels, and this helps them play a major role in controlling diabetes. It is also extremely beneficial to consume foods that play a role in preventing diabetes complications like heart and kidney diseases. These&nbsp;diabetic diet foods can play a major role in bringing the disorder under control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1. Leafy Greens</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Green, leafy vegetables are low in calories, while also being extremely nutritious. Being low in digestible carbs means that they play a major role in controlling blood sugar levels too. Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are rich in several vitamins and minerals like vitamin C. One study showed that increasing vitamin C intake reduced the fasting blood sugar levels for people with type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Cinnamon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Along with its strong antioxidant properties, cinnamon is also known for its ability to control diabetes. According to several controlled studies, cinnamon can help reduce blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Care must be taken to limit your intake of cassia cinnamon to less than a single teaspoon a day. The presence of coumarin in this type of cinnamon has been linked to health problems at higher doses. On the other hand, Ceylon cinnamon does not contain much coumarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. Fatty Fish</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Salmon, sardines, and mackerel are great sources of DHA and EPA, which are omega-3 fatty acids with major heart health benefits. Improving the intake of these fats could particularly benefit diabetics with a higher risk of heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>4. Chia Seeds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chia seeds are extremely rich in fiber, yet contain less digestible carbs. The viscous fiber found in these seeds lowers blood sugar levels by slowing down the rate at which food is moving through the gut and getting absorbed. Additionally, the fiber present in chia seeds also helps one feel full&nbsp;and prevents&nbsp;unnecessary weight gain. Chia seeds have also been shown to reduce blood pressure and inflammatory markers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>5. Greek Yogurt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Greek yogurt is a great dairy option for diabetics, given its ability to control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. This is partly due to the presence of probiotics in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Studies have also found that yogurt and other dairy products can result in weight loss and better body composition among people with type 2 diabetes. Greek Yogurt contains fewer carbs than conventional yogurt, while also being richer in protein.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>6. Flaxseeds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Flaxseeds contain insoluble fiber made up of lignans, which reduces heart disease risk and improves blood sugar control. A study showed that people with type 2 diabetes that consumed flaxseed lignans for 12 weeks experienced a major improvement in hemoglobin A1c.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>7. Nuts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">All nuts contain fiber, and are low in digestible fiber, although they may have them in varying levels. Research on various types of nuts has shown that their consumption can reduce inflammation, and lower HbA1c, blood sugar, and LDL levels in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">One study showed that people with diabetes who included 30 g of walnuts in their daily diet for a whole year lost weight, saw improvements in their body composition, and significantly lowered their insulin levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>8. Garlic</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Garlic is known to have some impressive health benefits. Some studies have shown that it can reduce inflammation, blood sugar, and LDL levels in people that have type 2 diabetes. It can also be very effective in reducing blood pressure levels in the body. In addition to that, garlic is also low in calories. A single clove contains only 4 calories with just 1 gram of carbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>9. Strawberries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Strawberries are rich in anthocyanins, the antioxidants that give them their red color. These antioxidants have been shown to reduce insulin and cholesterol levels right after a meal. They also reduce the risk of increased blood sugar levels and heart diseases in type 2 diabetes patients. A single cup of strawberries contains 49 calories and only 11 grams of carbs, 3 of which are fiber. This serving also ensures that one get', 'uploads/Leafy-Greens.jpg', 5),

It has many modifications so beginners can start with easier versions and work up to the standard push-up, while you can find a challenging variation if you are advanced. You can do the push-up as part of a&nbsp;bodyweight exercise session, a&nbsp;circuit training workout, or a strength workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The upper body muscles that come into play in the push-up are the deltoids of the shoulders, the pectoral muscles of the chest, the triceps and biceps of the upper arm, and the erector spinae of the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The&nbsp;abdominal muscles&nbsp;used to hold the body rigid during the push-up are the rectus abdominis and the transversus abdominis. As the push-up involves multiple joints, it is a&nbsp;compound exercise.1</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In daily life, you will often need to push against objects, from doors to shopping carts. The functional fitness you develop with push-ups will serve you well. Working the stabilizer muscles around the shoulders can help protect you from&nbsp;rotator cuff injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="background-color:#dddddd">Push-ups are also a measure of overall fitness, allowing you to assess whether you need to be doing more to keep your body in good working condition.</span></p>\r\n', '<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Get down on all fours, placing your hands slightly wider than your shoulders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Straighten your arms and legs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Pause, then push yourself back up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Repeat. &nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<h4 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Common Mistakes</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It is easy to start making errors with push-ups if you are fatiguing or if you haven&#39;t built enough core strength. Look for these and switch to an easier variation if you can&#39;t maintain the best form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1.Sagging in the Middle</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The most common problem is sagging in the middle, caused by not properly bracing the core and keeping the torso stiff throughout the movement. This is not only bad form, but it can also cause back pain. You can practice with a modified&nbsp;plank exercise&nbsp;to build your core strength. Once you master that, try doing a push-up on your knees, practicing keeping your torso stable.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2.Neck Alignment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Your neck should be in&nbsp;neutral alignment&nbsp;with the head in a straight line with the spine, eyes to the floor, and the top of your head pointed at the opposite wall. If you point your chin up or drop your head so much that you can see your toes, you are out of alignment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3.Locked Elbows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Locking your elbows at the top of the movement is a mistake you might make as you fatigue and want a little rest. But this places too much stress on the joints and can lead to strain or injury. Always keep a slight bend in the elbows. If you are fatigued, it&#39;s time to take a rest before doing another set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>4.Hands Too Far Forward</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If your hands are farther out from your body than your shoulders you are placing more strain on your shoulders.

It is better to switch to an easier modification (such as knee or incline push-ups) that you can do with the full range of motion.</p>\r\n', 'Chest'),

(6, 'Inchworm Exercise', 'uploads/inchworm.jpg', '<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Level:&nbsp;</strong>Beginner</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The inchworm exercise offers a little bit of everything&mdash;it helps strengthen the muscles of your anterior chain (the front half of your body) while stretching the muscles of your posterior chain (the back half of your body). And because it targets your entire body in some capacity, it gets the blood flowing. This makes it an excellent move to incorporate into an active warm-up before a strength training or&nbsp;high-intensity interval training routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The movement itself ends up looking exactly like its name&mdash;an inchworm. You start standing, reach your arms down toward the ground, walk your hands away from your feet, entering a plank-like position, before stepping your feet forward toward your hands and finally returning to a standing position. You then continue the worm-like crawl for time or repetitions.</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify">There are two ways to do the inchworm&mdash;one involves traveling across a distance, requiring you to have at least 15 to 20 feet of space to move, and the other simply has you stay in place, requiring no more space than roughly the length of your own body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While neither version is better or worse, the traveling version requires more engagement of your lower body and is considered the typical version of the exercise. If you have the space available, plan on using it, and follow these step-by-step instructions. If you don&#39;t have the space available, follow the modified version of the exercise, detailed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Stand tall, your feet roughly hip-distance apart. Check your posture&mdash;your ears should be aligned over your shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles, your abdominals engaged.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Take a breath in, then as you exhale, look down at the ground and start reaching your hands toward the floor in front of your feet, allowing your back to bend forward, rolling down one vertebra at a time. Allow your knees to bend slightly, as needed, to enable your hands to reach the ground.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Place your hands on the floor in front of your feet. Inhale and walk your hands forward, one at a time, allowing your heels to lift off the floor as your body begins to straighten. When your hands are directly under your shoulders, check your form&mdash;you should be in a full plank position with your core, chest, quads, triceps, and shoulders engaged, your body forming a straight line from heels to head.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Keep your legs relatively straight and begin walking your feet forward, one at a time, toward your hands. This should provide a nice stretch through your hamstrings, calves, and glutes as your hips start lifting toward the ceiling. Exhale as you step forward.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Stop when your feet are as close to your hands as you can comfortably bring them. Remember, you can bend your knees slightly to ease the stretch on your hamstrings, but try to keep them as straight as possible.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Return to standing by slowly rolling your back up from the hips, straightening one vertebra at a time. Inhale as you go. When you&#39;re back in the starting position, you&#39;ve completed one repetition. Continue for time or repetitions, depending on your workout.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', '<h4 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Benefits of Doing the Inchworm Exercise</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The inchworm exercise is a solid movement to add to just about any routine. Because it has the ability to strengthen and stretch different muscle groups at the same time, it&#39;s ideally positioned to be included as part of an active warm-up, or as part of a high-intensity interval training routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The strengthening part of the movement comes when you&#39;re entering, exiting, and holding the plank portion of the movement. As you step your hands forward, away from your feet, your shoulders, triceps, chest, and eventually your abdominals, the&nbsp;stabilizing muscles&nbsp;of your shoulders and hips, your glutes, and your quadriceps all engage to support your body&#39;s weight as you enter the&nbsp;plank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you have a good baseline level of strength through these muscle groups, you&#39;re unlikely to experience major strength gains from performing the inchworm. But because it fires up all these muscles, the exercise is perfect as a warm-up before a more taxing strength training workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Likewise, if you&#39;re doing a high-intensity interval training routine, you can use the inchworm as part of your &quot;rest&quot; intervals to keep your heart rate up while giving your cardiovascular system a bit of a break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The stretching part of the movement is particularly apparent as you reach your hands toward the floor and start walking them forward, and again as you walk your feet forward toward your hands. You&#39;ll feel the stretch through your hamstrings and calves, in particular, and might also feel a slight stretch through your glutes and low back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Also, if you perform the more challenging version of the exercise (detailed below), you may experience a slight stretch through your shoulders and chest as you walk your hands forward past the full-plank position into an extended plank. Again, incorporating the inchworm into an active warm-up is a great way to fluidly stretch the muscle groups you plan to target during your workout without performing&nbsp;static stretching</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the concept of an&nbsp;active warm-up, and why it&#39;s beneficial, the idea is to mentally and physically prepare your body for whatever workout you&#39;re about to take on. So, for instance, if you&#39;re planning on doing a lower-body strength training routine, an active warm-up would include exercises that hit the same muscle groups in the same general way as the exercises you&#39;re going to perform during your workout, but without using added resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Active warm-ups are also designed to stretch the muscle groups you&#39;re going to target without holding a stretch for a set period of time. This type of warm-up greases the wheels for your workout and helps prevent injuries. An exercise like the inchworm is ideal because it uses only your body weight to target just about every major muscle group. Try incorporating it with air squats,&nbsp;lunges, high knees, and lateral slides before your next strength training routine.</p>\r\n', 'Arms'),

This is not only bad form, but it can also cause back pain. You can practice with a modified&nbsp;plank exercise&nbsp;to build your core strength. Once you master that, try doing a push-up on your knees, practicing keeping your torso stable.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.Neck Alignment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your neck should be in&nbsp;neutral alignment&nbsp;with the head in a straight line with the spine, eyes to the floor, and the top of your head pointed at the opposite wall. If you point your chin up or drop your head so much that you can see your toes, you are out of alignment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.Locked Elbows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locking your elbows at the top of the movement is a mistake you might make as you fatigue and want a little rest. But this places too much stress on the joints and can lead to strain or injury. Always keep a slight bend in the elbows. If you are fatigued, it&#39;s time to take a rest before doing another set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.Hands Too Far Forward</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your hands are farther out from your body than your shoulders you are placing more strain on your shoulders. While you can vary how close your hands are together to get different effects, they should still be under your shoulders.2</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.Limited Range of Motion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are only going down partially with most of your push-ups, you aren&#39;t getting the full benefit. It is better to switch to an easier modification (such as knee or incline push-ups) that you can do with the full range of motion.</p>\r\n', 'Arms'),

In rugby and soccer, you push the ball during line-out or throw-in, respectively.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">But it&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;pushing sports&rdquo; that benefit from triceps dips. Wickham points out that the exercise also works your core: &ldquo;The core muscles help send power to our other muscles, including your arms and legs. So, by strengthening your core, tricep dips can make you a better frisbee player, runner, CrossFitter, football player, dancer, and so on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Reduce risk of injury</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&ldquo;The stronger you are&nbsp;<em>anywhere</em>, the more resilient and less injury-prone you&rsquo;ll be during fluke accidents,&rdquo; Wickham says. &ldquo;And having strong triceps and pecs, in general, helps support the health of your elbow and shoulder joints.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Say you take a misstep while you&rsquo;re on a walk. If you have a solid core (which triceps dips can help build!), you&rsquo;ll be more likely to stabilize your body before hitting the pavement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Increase stability</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Stability comes in clutch during literally everything, including when you&rsquo;re putting away groceries, throwing a ball, walking down the street, or driving your car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Boost metabolism</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Metabolism is science-speak for how quickly your body uses up energy (read: calories).
